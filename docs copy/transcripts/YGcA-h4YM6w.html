data-start="252.3" data-end="253.68">doesn't matter that desktop is more</span> <span data-start="253.68" data-end="255.84">popular than phone to do that we just</span> <span data-start="255.84" data-end="269.42">divide the metric by the total</span> <span data-start="269.43" data-end="271.81">now we have comparable results between</span> <span data-start="271.81" data-end="273.55">devices
