<p><span data-start="13.2" data-end="15.62">Are you fed up with console spam?</span> <span data-start="15.74" data-end="18.21">Sick of browser messages that tell you problems but</span> <span data-start="18.66" data-end="19.71">not how to fix them?</span> <span data-start="20.04" data-end="23.13">Well, the Issues tab is a new way for Chrome</span> <span data-start="23.34" data-end="25.8">DevTools to help you find and fix problems with your web</span> <span data-start="25.92" data-end="28.01">site. Problems detected by the browser are</span> <span data-start="28.97" data-end="32.01">presented in a structured format, separate</span> <span data-start="32.01" data-end="33.01">from the console.</span> <span data-start="33.89" data-end="36.81">And that also means your own console messages don't get</span> <span data-start="36.81" data-end="38.43">drowned out by browser warnings.</span> <span data-start="39.52" data-end="42.27">The Issues tab aggregates different types of problems.</span> <span data-start="42.73" data-end="46.11">It describes problems using clear and simple language,</span> <span data-start="46.57" data-end="50.11">explains how to fix them, and links to affected resources</span> <span data-start="50.32" data-end="51.49">within DevTools.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="52.82" data-end="55.12">And shows you where to find further guidance.</span> <span data-start="56.33" data-end="58.54">So let's run through that from start to finish.</span> <span data-start="59.12" data-end="60.96">First, you need a page with problems.</span> <span data-start="61" data-end="63.33">Well, for this example, we have a page with lots of</span> <span data-start="63.33" data-end="64.33">problems.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="64.71" data-end="67.46">Open the page in Chrome and then open Chrome DevTools.</span> <span data-start="68.26" data-end="70.67">As you can see, issues were detected.</span> <span data-start="71.3" data-end="74.55">Click the 'go to issues' button in the yellow warning bar.</span> <span data-start="75.22" data-end="78.02">You can also select the Issues tab from the 'More Tools'</span> <span data-start="78.02" data-end="79.85">menu or click on the blue icon at the</span> <span data-start="81.02" data-end="82.02">top of DevTools.</span> <span data-start="82.56" data-end="85.15">Now you might need to click the 'reload page' button</span> <span data-start="85.65" data-end="88.61">since DevTools can't collect requests while it's closed.</span> <span data-start="89.19" data-end="91.65">You'll notice that for the moment, warnings that used to</span> <span data-start="91.65" data-end="94.66">show up in the console still do as well as in the</span> <span data-start="94.66" data-end="95.66">Issues tab.</span> <span data-start="96.08" data-end="98.74">The initial version of the Issues tab checks for three</span> <span data-start="98.74" data-end="101.87">types of issue: cookie problems, mixed content,</span> <span data-start="102.62" data-end="105.92">cross-origin embedder policy — that's COEP — issues</span> <span data-start="106.04" data-end="108.13">as well. Future versions will support more</span> <span data-start="109.13" data-end="110.13">issue types.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="110.55" data-end="113.47">So click an item in the Issues tab and you'll see that</span> <span data-start="113.51" data-end="115.55">each item has four components.</span> <span data-start="115.97" data-end="118.97">A headline, describing the issue, a description</span> <span data-start="118.97" data-end="121.98">providing the context and the solution, and</span> <span data-start="122.06" data-end="124.6">an 'affected resources' section that links to the resources</span> <span data-start="125.02" data-end="127.56">within the appropriate DevTools contexts such as the</span> <span data-start="128.07" data-end="131.99">Network panel, and also links to further guidance.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="133.15" data-end="136.32">Click on items within affected resources to view details.</span> <span data-start="136.41" data-end="138.7">In this example, there is one cookie and one request.</span> <span data-start="138.7" data-end="141.87">Now the Issues tab explains problems</span> <span data-start="141.91" data-end="143.21">and tells you how to fix them.</span> <span data-start="143.37" data-end="145.96">But it can also show your resources in the appropriate</span> <span data-start="146.25" data-end="148.46">context within the DevTools themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="149.04" data-end="152.13">So click on a resource link to view the item in context.</span> <span data-start="152.59" data-end="154.17">In this example, click samesite-sandbox.glitch.me</span> <span data-start="156.47" data-end="158.51">to show the cookies attached to that request.</span> <span data-start="159.26" data-end="161.89">Scroll to view the item with a problem; in this case, the</span> <span data-start="161.89" data-end="162.89">cookie ck02.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="164.14" data-end="166.48">Hover over the Information icon on the right to see the</span> <span data-start="166.48" data-end="167.94">problem and how to fix it.</span> <span data-start="168.4" data-end="171.69">You can also go the other way. Right-click on an item</span> <span data-start="171.73" data-end="174.78">within DevTools to show issues associated with</span> <span data-start="174.78" data-end="177.66">it. We'll be adding more features to the Issues tab in the</span> <span data-start="177.66" data-end="180.99">future. So let us know what you think, how we could improve</span> <span data-start="181.03" data-end="183.83">the Issues tab and what features you'd like to see.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="184.66" data-end="187.54">You can comment on this video or file bug reports in</span> <span data-start="188" data-end="190.63">Crbug, which is the engineering team's bug tracker,</span> <span data-start="191.17" data-end="192.5">or send a tweet to @ChromeDevTools.</span> <span data-start="193.55" data-end="196.13">As ever, we really appreciate your feedback.</span> </p>
