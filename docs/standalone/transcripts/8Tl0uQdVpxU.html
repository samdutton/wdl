<p><span data-start="13.2" data-end="16.16">Hello and welcome to "Security and Privacy for the Open</span> <span data-start="16.16" data-end="19.08">Web". I'm Maud, and I'm a Developer Advocate for the Chrome</span> <span data-start="19.08" data-end="20.5">team recording from Berlin.</span> <span data-start="20.79" data-end="22.17">And I am Sam.</span> <span data-start="22.17" data-end="24.84">Coming to you live-ish from Tooting Bec</span> <span data-start="25.21" data-end="26.21">in South London.</span> <span data-start="26.38" data-end="29.38">OK. First, Sam, let's travel in time a</span> <span data-start="29.38" data-end="32.22">bit and understand what the "open web" means because the</span> <span data-start="32.22" data-end="34.22">web is open by definition, right?</span> <span data-start="34.51" data-end="35.68">Yeah. Well, I mean, sort of.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="35.89" data-end="38.14">The web was originally designed to be open and</span> <span data-start="38.94" data-end="42.06">transparent. In fact, Tim Berners-Lee envisaged</span> <span data-start="42.11" data-end="45.15">the web as a kind of read/write medium.</span> <span data-start="45.23" data-end="47.4">You know, the browser would be an editor as much as a</span> <span data-start="47.4" data-end="48.4">reader.</span> <span data-start="48.65" data-end="51.41">And right from the early days, the limited scope of what</span> <span data-start="51.41" data-end="54.49">browsers could do helped keep them safe for,</span> <span data-start="54.49" data-end="58.04">you know, anonymous, stateless document rendering.</span> <span data-start="58.46" data-end="60.29">But then capabilities and expectations</span> <span data-start="61.54" data-end="64.04">grew. And, you know, we wanted to log-in and then</span> <span data-start="64.59" data-end="66.46">e-commerce and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="66.76" data-end="69.17">And then we got phishing, malware, man-in-the-middle</span> <span data-start="69.93" data-end="71.34">attacks and all the rest.</span> <span data-start="71.43" data-end="74.72">Yeah. So in response, you know, we've had</span> <span data-start="74.97" data-end="78.14">browser sandboxing, ubiquitous HTTPS,</span> <span data-start="79.18" data-end="82.35">protections against malicious sites, plugin deprecation,</span> <span data-start="82.81" data-end="84.98">and all that stuff, which is great.</span> <span data-start="85.48" data-end="88.74">However, some of the web technologies designed</span> <span data-start="88.78" data-end="91.86">decades ago aren't being used in the simple</span> <span data-start="91.91" data-end="92.86">way that was intended.</span> <span data-start="93.37" data-end="95.83">You know, it was difficult in the 1990s to envisage how</span> <span data-start="95.83" data-end="97.62">user agent strings and cookies would</span> <span data-start="98.83" data-end="101.62">be used beyond their intended capabilities</span> <span data-start="101.92" data-end="102.92">in the 2020s.</span> <span data-start="103.75" data-end="106.75">And this evolution in how some web</span> <span data-start="106.75" data-end="109.76">technologies are able to be utilized, paired</span> <span data-start="109.76" data-end="112.76">with the rising expectations from users to</span> <span data-start="112.76" data-end="116.22">have more control and transparency over their personal</span> <span data-start="116.22" data-end="118.02">data, has led the whole web ecosystem</span> <span data-start="119.43" data-end="122.06">to evaluate longstanding practices.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="122.64" data-end="125.9">And now, more than ever, I think the web needs privacy</span> <span data-start="125.94" data-end="129.07">and security by default for all users.</span> <span data-start="129.99" data-end="132.99">I think we'll see an increasingly high proportion of people</span> <span data-start="132.99" data-end="136.2">on the web who've never used a browser before</span> <span data-start="136.24" data-end="139.2">or who are simply outside their normal browsing</span> <span data-start="139.2" data-end="142.29">habits. People may be looking for information</span> <span data-start="142.33" data-end="145.63">who may be in a crisis or just feeling vulnerable.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="146.13" data-end="148.84">And I actually think these are the hardest, most complex</span> <span data-start="149.5" data-end="152.47">and most important problems to solve on the</span> <span data-start="152.47" data-end="153.47">web right now.</span> <span data-start="154.13" data-end="156.14">But of course, this is not easy.</span> <span data-start="156.47" data-end="158.81">Even in terms of user interface design.</span> <span data-start="159.51" data-end="162.73">For example, how do you make quite complex concepts,</span> <span data-start="162.93" data-end="165.69">such as cookie management, understandable</span> <span data-start="165.98" data-end="168.23">for billions of users?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="168.65" data-end="172.11">Yes. So that's why users need transparency and control</span> <span data-start="172.11" data-end="173.28">in their browsers.</span> <span data-start="174.03" data-end="175.91">And it's not just browser features, right.</span> <span data-start="175.95" data-end="178.99">Web standards and defaults also need to change.</span> <span data-start="179.24" data-end="180.74">Yeah, that's absolutely true.</span> <span data-start="180.79" data-end="183.87">I mean, cookies, for example, and data such as</span> <span data-start="183.96" data-end="187">user agent strings that can be used for device</span> <span data-start="187.04" data-end="189.34">fingerprinting and to covertly track individual</span> <span data-start="190.34" data-end="191.3">users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="191.55" data-end="194.51">Also features such as the referrer header that</span> <span data-start="194.55" data-end="196.8">can reveal private browsing data.</span> <span data-start="197.34" data-end="200.39">As developers, we need to rethink the way we handle user</span> <span data-start="200.39" data-end="203.98">data. Do you really need all the data you access?</span> <span data-start="204.1" data-end="206.65">And is it clear to your users what you're doing with their</span> <span data-start="206.65" data-end="207.6">data?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="207.6" data-end="210.9">Yeah, because like as a developer, you're actually best</span> <span data-start="210.94" data-end="213.86">placed to understand potential problems</span> <span data-start="214.15" data-end="215.28">and help fix them.</span> <span data-start="215.7" data-end="218.37">So, OK, let's run through today's sessions.</span> <span data-start="218.41" data-end="221.49">We'll be talking about security, privacy,</span> <span data-start="221.7" data-end="223.04">payments, and identity.</span> <span data-start="223.5" data-end="226.79">Yeah. First up, our colleague Rowan Merewood has</span> <span data-start="226.79" data-end="229.5">some recipes to help you manage your cookies,</span> <span data-start="230.17" data-end="232.92">whether or not you've heard about SameSite and changes to</span> <span data-start="233.17" data-end="234.17">cookie defaults.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="234.46" data-end="237.43">If you're using any kind of third party content,</span> <span data-start="237.51" data-end="240.68">such as ads or you're doing anything</span> <span data-start="240.68" data-end="243.81">with cookies on your site, you should definitely check</span> <span data-start="243.81" data-end="244.81">out his session.</span> <span data-start="245.39" data-end="248.35">Second, thinking about the cross-origin web, you need</span> <span data-start="248.35" data-end="249.86">to prevent information leaks.</span> <span data-start="249.9" data-end="252.57">And that's where powerful protections like the COOP and</span> <span data-start="252.94" data-end="254.73">COEP policy headers come in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="255.44" data-end="258.03">To understand how this can protect your website, check out</span> <span data-start="258.03" data-end="259.7">the great session from our colleague Eiji Kitamura.</span> <span data-start="261.03" data-end="263.41">OK. So that's all nice.</span> <span data-start="263.45" data-end="266.29">But how do you actually debug that stuff?</span> <span data-start="266.33" data-end="268.62">Like SameSite cookies and COOP and COEP?</span> <span data-start="269.25" data-end="272.5">Well, the new Issues tab in Chrome</span> <span data-start="272.5" data-end="274">DevTools is there to help you.</span> <span data-start="274.67" data-end="277.8">The Issues tab makes it much easier to find and</span> <span data-start="277.8" data-end="281.05">fix problems instead of console message</span> <span data-start="281.05" data-end="284.26">clutter you get clear instructions</span> <span data-start="284.43" data-end="285.72">on how to fix problems.</span> <span data-start="285.85" data-end="288.73">So with this sessions, you'll learn techniques to not</span> <span data-start="288.73" data-end="290.65">passively leak your users' data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="291.35" data-end="292.65">And there's a pattern here.</span> <span data-start="293.23" data-end="296.03">Debugging is important, but how can you and your team</span> <span data-start="296.03" data-end="298.82">develop a mindset around privacy and security</span> <span data-start="299.24" data-end="300.74">and prepare for the future?</span> <span data-start="301.62" data-end="304.58">Rowan and I thought about this and put together strategies</span> <span data-start="304.58" data-end="307.2">with concrete examples of web APIs and HTTP headers</span> <span data-start="308.08" data-end="310.58">you surely know, to help you make sure you're using</span> <span data-start="311.46" data-end="312.46">just the data you need.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="312.92" data-end="315.25">And speaking of user data, a crucial entry point</span> <span data-start="316" data-end="318.8">for this is the ubiquitous sign-in</span> <span data-start="319.09" data-end="321.55">form. And this is particularly important right now</span> <span data-start="322.43" data-end="325.93">when lots of sites need to be accessible to new</span> <span data-start="325.97" data-end="326.97">users.</span> <span data-start="327.27" data-end="329.81">Now, in my session, I'll show you how to use cross-platform</span> <span data-start="330.69" data-end="333.69">browser features to build a simple email/password</span> <span data-start="334.36" data-end="337.4">log in form that's secure, accessible,</span> <span data-start="337.44" data-end="338.78">and easy to use.</span> <span data-start="339.19" data-end="342.07">Just like the sign-in experience, you need payment</span> <span data-start="342.2" data-end="343.95">flows to be clear and safe.</span> <span data-start="344.41" data-end="346.37">So what's new in web payments?</span> <span data-start="346.79" data-end="349.04">Eiji Kitamura will guide you through this.</span> <span data-start="349.04" data-end="351.96">So if your website uses payments, make sure to check this</span> <span data-start="352.17" data-end="353.17">session out.</span> <span data-start="353.29" data-end="355.34">Okay, so that's it for the sessions.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="355.38" data-end="358.51">But we'd also like to tell you about one really important</span> <span data-start="358.51" data-end="361.68">initiative that we're all involved with, the Privacy</span> <span data-start="361.68" data-end="362.68">Sandbox.</span> <span data-start="363.18" data-end="365.76">Now, more than ever, people need to know that private</span> <span data-start="366.35" data-end="368.06">data stays private.</span> <span data-start="368.97" data-end="370.93">On the other hand, people want to do stuff on the web</span> <span data-start="370.93" data-end="372.64">that's private and personal.</span> <span data-start="372.69" data-end="375.86">You know, you want to go shopping, use your bank online,</span> <span data-start="376.4" data-end="379.86">communicate private information and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="380.11" data-end="382.61">And keeping data safe can't just be</span> <span data-start="383.11" data-end="386.2">about constraints. We can't just say no to everything.</span> <span data-start="386.45" data-end="389.2">The problem is keeping your users safe is not just about</span> <span data-start="389.62" data-end="391.37">getting your own house in order.</span> <span data-start="391.75" data-end="395.08">It's not just about first-party interactions because</span> <span data-start="395.13" data-end="398.13">most web sites use services from other companies</span> <span data-start="398.13" data-end="401.13">to provide analytics or videos and do lots</span> <span data-start="401.13" data-end="402.42">of other useful stuff.</span> <span data-start="403.13" data-end="405.59">Most notably, ads are included in webpages via</span> <span data-start="406.47" data-end="408.1">third-party JavaScript and iframes.</span> <span data-start="409.06" data-end="412.06">And ad views, clicks, and conversions are measured</span> <span data-start="412.1" data-end="414.14">via third-party cookies and scripts.</span> <span data-start="414.89" data-end="417.65">But when you visit a website, you may not be aware of these</span> <span data-start="417.65" data-end="420.07">third parties and what they're doing with your data.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="420.69" data-end="423.53">And actually, publishers and web developers themselves may</span> <span data-start="423.65" data-end="426.82">not have visibility on the entire third-party supply chain.</span> <span data-start="427.99" data-end="431.2">Ad targeting, conversion measurement, and other use cases</span> <span data-start="431.2" data-end="434.25">currently rely on stable cross-site identity.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.91" data-end="437.38">Historically, this has been done with third-party cookies.</span> <span data-start="437.42" data-end="439.79">But today, browsers have begun to restrict access</span> <span data-start="440.38" data-end="441.38">to these.</span> <span data-start="441.84" data-end="444.51">Other mechanisms for cross-site user tracking are also</span> <span data-start="445.01" data-end="447.47">being used, such as covert browser storage, device</span> <span data-start="448.14" data-end="451.43">fingerprinting, and requests for personal information like</span> <span data-start="451.51" data-end="452.68">email addresses.</span> <span data-start="453.48" data-end="455.14">And this is a dilemma for the web.</span> <span data-start="455.23" data-end="456.9">How can legitimate third-party use</span> <span data-start="458.27" data-end="461.4">cases be supported without enabling users</span> <span data-start="461.4" data-end="462.94">to be tracked across sites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="463.69" data-end="466.61">In particular, how can websites fund content</span> <span data-start="466.65" data-end="469.2">by enabling third parties to show ads and measure ad</span> <span data-start="469.57" data-end="472.91">performance, but not allow individual users</span> <span data-start="472.91" data-end="473.95">to be profiled?</span> <span data-start="474.41" data-end="477.58">How can advertisers and site owners evaluate a user's</span> <span data-start="477.62" data-end="481.13">authenticity without resorting to dark patterns</span> <span data-start="481.21" data-end="483.25">such as device fingerprinting?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="483.76" data-end="486.13">Well, this is where the Privacy Sandbox comes in.</span> <span data-start="486.67" data-end="488.84">And just to avoid confusion, this is not the</span> <span data-start="489.72" data-end="493.1">same as the browser sandbox architecture</span> <span data-start="493.22" data-end="495.68">you may have heard of though it does build on some</span> <span data-start="496.23" data-end="498.6">of the same ideas of keeping your data safe.</span> <span data-start="499.77" data-end="502.65">The Privacy Sandbox is a set of proposals to implement</span> <span data-start="502.65" data-end="504.73">privacy-preserving APIs to support business</span> <span data-start="505.69" data-end="509.16">models that fund websites in the absence</span> <span data-start="509.32" data-end="511.78">of mechanisms like third-party cookies.</span> <span data-start="512.7" data-end="515.7">Now the Privacy Sandbox supports five core</span> <span data-start="515.75" data-end="519">use cases for a world without third-party cookies:</span> <span data-start="519.42" data-end="522">measurement for ads and other third party content,</span> <span data-start="522.46" data-end="525.92">relevance features for advertising, fraud detection</span> <span data-start="526.09" data-end="529.18">distinguishing real humans from bots and spammers,</span> <span data-start="529.8" data-end="533.01">getting rid of covert tracking, and finally,</span> <span data-start="533.01" data-end="535.18">secure and simple identity management across</span> <span data-start="536.18" data-end="539.31">sites. So we need browsers to support</span> <span data-start="539.31" data-end="542.69">third party use cases in a future without cookies.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="543.02" data-end="544.32">But whatever happens, users</span> <span data-start="546.15" data-end="549.49">need cookie security and choice right now.</span> <span data-start="549.86" data-end="552.87">So how did the Privacy Sandbox proposal satisfy third</span> <span data-start="552.87" data-end="553.99">party use cases?</span> <span data-start="554.2" data-end="557.25">So I'm not going to go into the gory details of every</span> <span data-start="557.25" data-end="559.87">single one of the Privacy Sandbox proposals here.</span> <span data-start="560.29" data-end="563.29">Shameless self promotion, but you really should</span> <span data-start="563.29" data-end="566.96">read our article "Digging into the Privacy Sandbox",</span> <span data-start="567.34" data-end="569.8">which outlines all the proposals.</span> <span data-start="570.22" data-end="573.34">But you know what we really need though is feedback</span> <span data-start="573.39" data-end="574.6">on the proposals.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="574.72" data-end="577.47">In particular, to suggest missing use cases</span> <span data-start="577.72" data-end="580.69">and more private ways to accomplish their goals.</span> <span data-start="581.69" data-end="584.56">The Chrome team is responding to feedback on the proposals</span> <span data-start="585.19" data-end="588.23">on GitHub and in W3C forums.</span> <span data-start="588.53" data-end="590.7">And we really hope you'll join the discussion.</span> <span data-start="591.15" data-end="594.12">And this is especially true if you work for a publisher,</span> <span data-start="594.41" data-end="596.99">advertiser, or an ad tech company.</span> <span data-start="597.54" data-end="600.58">And if you have other questions, feedback, or ideas to</span> <span data-start="600.58" data-end="603.5">share on today's sessions, ping us on Twitter @ChromiumDev</span> <span data-start="604.38" data-end="605.63">with the hashtag #webdevlive.</span> <span data-start="606.42" data-end="609.21">Yeah. Thanks, Maud. And if you want to get in touch, we'll</span> <span data-start="609.38" data-end="612.47">be online to answer questions in the live chat</span> <span data-start="612.51" data-end="614.59">during the web.dev LIVE event.</span> </p>
