<p><span data-start="12.3" data-end="14.22">Hello and welcome. My name is Stephen Fluin.</span> <span data-start="15.22" data-end="17.47">I'm a Developer Advocate on the Angular team here at</span> <span data-start="17.47" data-end="19.93">Google. My job is really fun because I get to help</span> <span data-start="20.51" data-end="21.77">developers be successful with Angular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="22.27" data-end="24.77">And I get to spend a lot of time listening and engaging</span> <span data-start="24.77" data-end="27.31">with the community, so we can reflect your needs onto the</span> <span data-start="27.31" data-end="30.19">team. One things that we learned, having worked with a lot</span> <span data-start="30.4" data-end="33.4">of developers across the world, is that staying up</span> <span data-start="33.4" data-end="35.2">to date is really, really important.</span> <span data-start="35.24" data-end="37.41">And so today's talk is all about how to keep your</span> <span data-start="37.45" data-end="40.08">application as fast as possible and as fresh as possible</span> <span data-start="40.41" data-end="42.79">using Angular. We're gonna be diving into some of the best</span> <span data-start="42.79" data-end="44.71">practices that you should be following as an application</span> <span data-start="44.71" data-end="47.79">developer. And we'll take a look at live code and see how</span> <span data-start="47.79" data-end="50.59">you can actually go in and debug and build your application</span> <span data-start="50.59" data-end="52.71">out. So let's actually gets started.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="53.05" data-end="56.26">So if we take a look at we've got here, this is a</span> <span data-start="56.38" data-end="58.43">application that I've built using the Angular CLI.</span> <span data-start="59.01" data-end="61.14">So it's a very, very basic application that should look</span> <span data-start="61.14" data-end="64.02">very, very familiar. It's basically we ran "ng new" and we</span> <span data-start="64.14" data-end="65.85">installed something called Angular Material.</span> <span data-start="65.89" data-end="68.73">And so if you take a look at the AppComponent, I've put in</span> <span data-start="68.81" data-end="71.4">an app dashboard. And so if we ran a command like "ng</span> <span data-start="71.44" data-end="74.4">serve", what we would see is a normal</span> <span data-start="74.4" data-end="76.78">dashboard of an application that's coming from Angular</span> <span data-start="76.86" data-end="78.74">Material. So we've got a few dependencies installed.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="78.95" data-end="81.41">We've got a few other things installed and all that should</span> <span data-start="81.41" data-end="83.16">just be coming to you kind of automatically.</span> <span data-start="83.62" data-end="86.37">So here we go. This is just the default blank dashboard.</span> <span data-start="86.66" data-end="88.46">And so even though we haven't written a ton of code, we've</span> <span data-start="88.46" data-end="91.13">got the application up and running and it's pulling in</span> <span data-start="91.46" data-end="93.13">a ton of code, right? We're pulling in the features of</span> <span data-start="93.3" data-end="95.8">Angular necessary for these animations, for these menus,</span> <span data-start="95.84" data-end="98.51">for these dialogs, as well as for all of this content</span> <span data-start="98.59" data-end="100.76">around this dashboard that a user could interact with and</span> <span data-start="100.76" data-end="103.56">engage with. And so the first thing I want to do in order</span> <span data-start="103.56" data-end="106.1">to make my application fast as possible is I really want to</span> <span data-start="106.1" data-end="108.6">understand my application. And so we're gonna make a couple</span> <span data-start="108.6" data-end="111.73">changes within our build configuration in the angular.json</span> <span data-start="112.31" data-end="114.86">file. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna find the</span> <span data-start="114.9" data-end="117.15">angular.json file. You're gonna find this directly in the</span> <span data-start="117.19" data-end="118.74">root of your application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="119.28" data-end="121.49">And what we're gonna do is we're going to find in the</span> <span data-start="121.53" data-end="124.74">Production Build settings, we're going to change</span> <span data-start="124.74" data-end="126.25">two settings here.</span> <span data-start="126.29" data-end="128.71">We're going to say a sourceMap. I'm gonna change that from</span> <span data-start="128.71" data-end="132.04">false to true, as well as in our</span> <span data-start="132.75" data-end="134.67">namedChunks, we're gonna turn that on to true.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="135.42" data-end="137.84">What sourceMap does is this will actually take my</span> <span data-start="138.05" data-end="141.01">application and map all of the generated JavaScript</span> <span data-start="141.39" data-end="143.72">that comes out of the build and map it back into</span> <span data-start="144.47" data-end="146.89">the code that that JavaScript came from.</span> <span data-start="146.97" data-end="149.39">So if some of the generated code came from Angular</span> <span data-start="149.69" data-end="151.69">Material, we'll see that. If it came from Angular itself,</span> <span data-start="151.69" data-end="153.98">we'll see that. And we'll even see things like the</span> <span data-start="154.02" data-end="157.15">generated JavaScript being mapped back to my HTML and</span> <span data-start="157.23" data-end="159.78">into the application code that I'm writing for all the</span> <span data-start="159.78" data-end="160.91">components that I'm creating.</span> <span data-start="160.99" data-end="163.99">So source maps are really great way for you to understand</span> <span data-start="164.24" data-end="167.12">what's going on in your application and the relationship</span> <span data-start="167.12" data-end="170.04">between what happens in the code you write in the IDE and</span> <span data-start="170.04" data-end="171.87">the code being delivered to your users.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="172.29" data-end="174.63">And so there's a lot of steps that we end up taking along</span> <span data-start="174.63" data-end="176.55">that way, right? There's the angular compiler that takes</span> <span data-start="176.55" data-end="178.59">that HTML and turns it into JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="178.8" data-end="181.18">But there's also other steps that we do, like optimizations</span> <span data-start="181.18" data-end="183.47">where we'll change some of the property names.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.72" data-end="185.97">You've got bundling so that we get all of this JavaScript</span> <span data-start="185.97" data-end="188.81">coming down as a single kind of cohesive bundle that makes</span> <span data-start="188.81" data-end="191.39">sense to browsers. And so sourceMap allows us to follow</span> <span data-start="191.39" data-end="194.36">that path, follow that process, and give us really good</span> <span data-start="194.4" data-end="196.9">insights. And so what we can do is, having made these two</span> <span data-start="196.9" data-end="199.82">changes, we can actually now go and run the ng</span> <span data-start="200.07" data-end="201.07">build  â€” prod.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="202.91" data-end="205.45">What that will do is that will create a production build of</span> <span data-start="205.45" data-end="207.2">our application, which is normally what you ship down to</span> <span data-start="207.28" data-end="210.04">browsers. But because we've turned on source maps and we</span> <span data-start="210.16" data-end="213.17">turned on namedChunks, we'll actually see the JavaScript</span> <span data-start="213.17" data-end="215.08">and be able to analyze those chunks.</span> <span data-start="215.46" data-end="217.29">And so we're also going to using another tool today called</span> <span data-start="217.42" data-end="218.42">source-map-explorer.</span> <span data-start="218.84" data-end="222.01">There's a bunch of other tools out there that developers</span> <span data-start="222.01" data-end="224.43">use to analyze bundle size and chunk size.</span> <span data-start="224.68" data-end="226.72">But we on the Angular team actually really strongly</span> <span data-start="226.72" data-end="228.76">recommend that you only use source-map-explorer because</span> <span data-start="229.14" data-end="231.64">other tools out there like webpack-bundle-analyzer that</span> <span data-start="231.64" data-end="234.6">categorically misrecognize some of those steps within</span> <span data-start="234.6" data-end="236.98">our process. And so we've done that production build, and</span> <span data-start="237.4" data-end="240.07">now whenever you want to actually take a look at what a</span> <span data-start="240.86" data-end="242.32">source map looks like, we can just run source-map-explorer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.07" data-end="244.66">If you don't have this installed, you can just install it</span> <span data-start="244.66" data-end="246.87">globally: "yarn global add source-map-explorer".</span> <span data-start="248.49" data-end="251">Or you can install it local to your project.</span> <span data-start="251.12" data-end="253.41">Whichever makes sense to you, just go and do that.</span> <span data-start="254.21" data-end="255.21">What we'll do is we'll run source-map-explorer,</span> <span data-start="257.46" data-end="260.3">and we will pass it in the JavaScript file that we</span> <span data-start="260.55" data-end="262.67">want to analyze. And so we can see it, we've got our dist</span> <span data-start="262.67" data-end="264.63">folder here and we're gonna look at the es2015</span> <span data-start="265.63" data-end="267.18">version of our JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="267.64" data-end="270.39">So if we run that, it's gonna pop up in a web browser, and</span> <span data-start="270.64" data-end="273.31">we're going to see this visual interactive story about</span> <span data-start="273.73" data-end="276.81">our applications. So we can see our overall bundle size, in</span> <span data-start="276.81" data-end="279.23">terms of minified but not compressed, JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="279.73" data-end="281.44">So it'll actually be a little bit smaller when it goes over</span> <span data-start="281.44" data-end="282.99">the network. We have about</span> <span data-start="284.95" data-end="286.41">452 kilobytes of application.</span> <span data-start="286.78" data-end="288.74">And what's really, really helpful here is that you can see</span> <span data-start="288.74" data-end="290.28">where that bundle size is coming from.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="290.28" data-end="293.16">So you can see animations is 64 kilobytes</span> <span data-start="293.62" data-end="295.75">and your material is about 56 kilobytes.</span> <span data-start="296.42" data-end="299.46">We've got things like HTTP where we might</span> <span data-start="299.46" data-end="301.34">not actually need these things. And we might not even know</span> <span data-start="301.34" data-end="302.92">that they are in our bundle. We might have forgotten at</span> <span data-start="302.92" data-end="304.88">some point along the way. So you can see I'm pulling in</span> <span data-start="304.88" data-end="306.43">forms and HTTP.</span> <span data-start="306.93" data-end="309.64">If we actually go into our application, now that we know</span> <span data-start="309.68" data-end="310.68">that those things are there we can say, "Hey.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="311.31" data-end="312.68">I don't actually need that for this dashboard". Right? Like</span> <span data-start="312.68" data-end="315.56">we're not â€” if we look at the content I'm showing you,</span> <span data-start="315.81" data-end="317.94">there's no form data here. There's no data coming from the</span> <span data-start="317.94" data-end="320.86">internet. And I can go into my AppModule and</span> <span data-start="320.86" data-end="322.82">I could pull those out. Okay? So I'll just comment these</span> <span data-start="322.82" data-end="324.65">out because we don't need a HTTP or forms.</span> <span data-start="325.07" data-end="327.86">What should happen is when I do my next production bundle,</span> <span data-start="329.11" data-end="330.45">all of that code is going to be left out.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="330.45" data-end="332.79">So we're going to be able to see that our bundle size will</span> <span data-start="332.79" data-end="335.95">come down from around 450 KB to a little bit less</span> <span data-start="335.95" data-end="337.5">than that, which is really, really nice. And it should</span> <span data-start="337.5" data-end="340.46">actually be exactly leaving out the size of the HTTP bundle</span> <span data-start="340.63" data-end="342.42">and the size of the forms bundle.</span> <span data-start="342.88" data-end="345.51">And so source maps are one of the best tools in your</span> <span data-start="345.59" data-end="348.3">toolbox. And we really recommend that every developer be</span> <span data-start="348.3" data-end="349.3">using source-map-explorer.</span> <span data-start="349.59" data-end="351.93">Using this on a regular basis to understand your</span> <span data-start="351.93" data-end="353.51">application, especially when you're doing any sort of</span> <span data-start="353.51" data-end="354.81">performance optimization.</span> <span data-start="355.47" data-end="357.94">Now, let's say that you are looking at your bundle and</span> <span data-start="357.94" data-end="359.85">you're saying it's still too big, but I need all of those</span> <span data-start="359.85" data-end="361.65">features. I need all of those capabilities.</span> <span data-start="362.23" data-end="365.03">Fortunately, the Angular CLI offers a lot of really smart</span> <span data-start="365.03" data-end="367.32">capabilities. One of those capabilities is being able to</span> <span data-start="367.61" data-end="370.53">take an application and build out lazy loaded modules.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="370.53" data-end="372.45">And so let's actually go ahead and do this.</span> <span data-start="372.49" data-end="375.04">And so I'm going to use the CLI here and I'm going to say</span> <span data-start="375.08" data-end="376.37">"ng", which is the Angular command.</span> <span data-start="376.7" data-end="379.54">And I'm gonna say "generate module", and I'm going to give</span> <span data-start="379.54" data-end="381.63">it a root module that it's going to connect</span> <span data-start="382.54" data-end="384.46">back to. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a</span> <span data-start="384.46" data-end="387.09">separate part of our application where we can pull in</span> <span data-start="387.13" data-end="389.72">features that we need and just leave all of that code</span> <span data-start="389.76" data-end="391.51">outside of the main bundle. And so we're going to generate</span> <span data-start="391.51" data-end="394.35">a module here and I'll just link it back to the module</span> <span data-start="394.64" data-end="397.27">known as App Module, which is the root of my application.</span> <span data-start="397.85" data-end="398.85">And now I'm going to give it a route.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="399.18" data-end="401.94">And so what this does is it automatically wires up this</span> <span data-start="401.98" data-end="405.07">module to be lazy-loaded whenever a user hits that route.</span> <span data-start="405.15" data-end="407.61">And so we'll just make, for example, an about page.</span> <span data-start="408.61" data-end="410.7">And so it is going to do it's going to generate a module</span> <span data-start="410.7" data-end="411.7">called "AboutModule".</span> <span data-start="412.61" data-end="415.03">It's gonna be able to route to it and then is gonna give me</span> <span data-start="415.03" data-end="416.03">an AboutComponent.</span> <span data-start="416.54" data-end="418.54">So we can see all of that in our source code.</span> <span data-start="418.58" data-end="421.25">So it's just close all these files and we're gonna see</span> <span data-start="421.58" data-end="423.63">it created a new About folder with our new</span> <span data-start="424.59" data-end="426.17">module and our new code.</span> <span data-start="426.67" data-end="428.63">And so if we do another production build,</span> <span data-start="430.05" data-end="431.76">what we'll actually see, because we</span> <span data-start="433.01" data-end="435.64">turned on namedChunks, we'll actually get out now, not</span> <span data-start="436.14" data-end="438.02">only a main chunk, a MainModule, we're</span> <span data-start="439.18" data-end="440.35">also going to get out an AboutModule.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="440.73" data-end="443.77">We can see and independently verify the size of that</span> <span data-start="443.77" data-end="446.9">module and independently verify what the</span> <span data-start="447.07" data-end="449.57">dependencies of that module are doing to the overall bundle</span> <span data-start="449.57" data-end="450.61">size of our application.</span> <span data-start="450.9" data-end="452.74">And so what you'll see is that by default, an Angular</span> <span data-start="452.74" data-end="454.87">module is really, really small. It's very, very thin.</span> <span data-start="454.87" data-end="456.49">It doesn't add a ton of bundle size your application.</span> <span data-start="456.78" data-end="459.66">It's almost always the dependencies that you are pulling in</span> <span data-start="459.66" data-end="461.83">as a developer, the features that you are reaching out for.</span> <span data-start="462.66" data-end="465.67">And what Angular will do is, intelligently based on the</span> <span data-start="466.08" data-end="469.09">where you do the imports, will lazy load and split</span> <span data-start="469.09" data-end="472.09">that code. So if you remember, we pulled HTTP and forms</span> <span data-start="472.13" data-end="474.97">out of our main chunk, we can actually now pull that in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="475.09" data-end="477.47">And so you can see we've generated a â€” Let's just</span> <span data-start="478.06" data-end="480.93">clear this out. Let's take a look in our dist folder here.</span> <span data-start="481.6" data-end="484.52">You can see we've got a main chunk and now we've got</span> <span data-start="484.6" data-end="486.52">this nice new AboutModule.</span> <span data-start="486.86" data-end="489.73">And so you can see in the es2015 version our AboutModule</span> <span data-start="490.15" data-end="492.15">is only about 1.1K of code.</span> <span data-start="492.19" data-end="494.15">So it's just that AboutComponent because it doesn't have</span> <span data-start="494.15" data-end="497.16">any dependencies. But if we add back in more dependencies</span> <span data-start="497.24" data-end="499.99">into that chunk, if we wanted to pull in, for example,</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="500.04" data-end="502.62">Angular Material into that AboutModule, then it's going to</span> <span data-start="502.62" data-end="504.62">pull in that code. But it's going to do it very, very</span> <span data-start="504.62" data-end="506.79">intelligently. It's going to lazy load all of that code.</span> <span data-start="506.88" data-end="509.29">So if you haven't set up lazy loading before, it's really,</span> <span data-start="509.29" data-end="511.59">really easy. Just generate a new module with that command</span> <span data-start="511.59" data-end="514.09">that I showed where we generate a module and we hang it</span> <span data-start="514.13" data-end="516.39">onto the routing structure of our application.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="517.51" data-end="519.6">All right. Next up, I want to talk a little bit about what</span> <span data-start="519.76" data-end="521.6">happens after we build an application, after we've been</span> <span data-start="521.6" data-end="523.43">building it out and we've added more and more features.</span> <span data-start="523.85" data-end="525.6">It's very, very easy to backslide.</span> <span data-start="525.89" data-end="528.19">One of things that the Chrome team has seen consistently is</span> <span data-start="528.19" data-end="530.52">that even applications that spend a ton of time building</span> <span data-start="530.52" data-end="533.03">great performance into their apps tend to backslide because</span> <span data-start="533.07" data-end="534.78">we as developers, we want to add more features.</span> <span data-start="534.78" data-end="537.07">We want to push more functionality to our users.</span> <span data-start="537.16" data-end="539.45">And that often comes with more dependencies, which</span> <span data-start="539.62" data-end="542.12">sometimes we don't realize is negatively affecting our</span> <span data-start="542.12" data-end="544.62">bundle size. And so one of the features that's built into</span> <span data-start="544.62" data-end="546.29">the Angular CLI is called "bundle budgets".</span> <span data-start="547" data-end="548.54">And so, again, if we go back into our angular.json.</span> <span data-start="548.54" data-end="550.25">So we'll just search for that.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="550.92" data-end="553.55">We can see this nice little budget section.</span> <span data-start="553.84" data-end="555.59">And what this does is it allows you to set several</span> <span data-start="555.59" data-end="557.38">different budgets for your application.</span> <span data-start="558.14" data-end="559.72">By default, we give you two out of the box.</span> <span data-start="559.72" data-end="560.97">We give you an initial budget.</span> <span data-start="561.22" data-end="563.14">So this is the JavaScript that it takes</span> <span data-start="564.18" data-end="566.81">to load the initial page of your application.</span> <span data-start="566.81" data-end="569.86">So right now, we are warning at</span> <span data-start="570.06" data-end="572.65">2 MB. So we'll see a warning as part of our build if our</span> <span data-start="572.73" data-end="573.94">application is over 2 MB.</span> <span data-start="574.69" data-end="577.32">And our build will actually error out if it's more than 5</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="577.57" data-end="580.03">MB. And so those are very, very conservative defaults.</span> <span data-start="580.07" data-end="582.87">We recommend you turn those as small as you can to really</span> <span data-start="582.99" data-end="584.7">just give yourself a knowledge of when you're increasing</span> <span data-start="584.7" data-end="587.04">your bundle sizes. It's a conscious choice rather than an</span> <span data-start="587.08" data-end="589.5">accident. You'll see we also have a few other types of</span> <span data-start="589.5" data-end="591.63">budgets, including any component style.</span> <span data-start="591.92" data-end="595.05">So what this says is that any scoped styles to a component,</span> <span data-start="595.71" data-end="596.92">we want to keep those under 5 KB.</span> <span data-start="597.55" data-end="599.97">And we are going to error out if they become above 10 KB.</span> <span data-start="600.3" data-end="602.8">And there's a few more that you can see if you just take a</span> <span data-start="602.8" data-end="603.81">look in your IDE.</span> <span data-start="604.22" data-end="606.68">You've got allScript, so that's just the total sum</span> <span data-start="607.35" data-end="608.48">of all the scripts in my application.</span> <span data-start="609.19" data-end="611.06">AnyScript are any individual scripts shouldn't be bigger</span> <span data-start="611.06" data-end="613.9">than this. The whole bundle overall, all those sorts of</span> <span data-start="613.9" data-end="615.36">things, so we've got a whole bunch of different features</span> <span data-start="615.4" data-end="618.11">that allow you to really take control and understand and</span> <span data-start="618.15" data-end="620.24">prevent bundle size increases.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="620.32" data-end="621.91">So that's a really, really helpful tool.</span> <span data-start="621.95" data-end="624.37">So those are some of the top things that you should be</span> <span data-start="624.37" data-end="626.62">doing to keep your application as fast as possible.</span> <span data-start="627" data-end="629.33">But one of the best things you can do</span> <span data-start="629.96" data-end="632.25">that doesn't take a lot of work is actually staying up to</span> <span data-start="632.25" data-end="633.25">date with Angular.</span> <span data-start="633.59" data-end="636.21">So if we jump back to the terminal here, what we'll see is</span> <span data-start="636.21" data-end="638.59">that I actually created this Angular application on an old</span> <span data-start="638.59" data-end="640.68">version of Angular, it is running version 8.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="640.97" data-end="642.89">So version 8 is not the latest version.</span> <span data-start="643.55" data-end="646.47">Version 9 as of this filming is the latest version and</span> <span data-start="646.56" data-end="647.56">version 10 is coming out.</span> <span data-start="647.97" data-end="650.27">But it's always the same. So if you're on an out of date</span> <span data-start="650.27" data-end="652.73">version of Angular, your bundle size is going to be bigger</span> <span data-start="652.77" data-end="654.98">and slower than it needs to be. Because what happens is</span> <span data-start="655.44" data-end="658.4">over time, every time we do a release, the Angular team is</span> <span data-start="658.4" data-end="659.7">looking at what can we do better?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="660.2" data-end="662.49">With the release of version 8, we actually made a huge step</span> <span data-start="662.49" data-end="664.78">forward by automatically doing something called</span> <span data-start="664.78" data-end="667.24">Differential Loading where because we have this opinionated</span> <span data-start="667.54" data-end="670.66">control of the entire toolchain, we understand</span> <span data-start="670.87" data-end="672.29">how to make your production bundles.</span> <span data-start="672.29" data-end="675.46">And so what we did is we said, "Hey, modern browsers</span> <span data-start="675.46" data-end="678.21">are capable of loading JavaScript differently than legacy</span> <span data-start="678.21" data-end="680.76">browsers that don't support something called ES modules.</span> <span data-start="681.13" data-end="683.76">And so using that knowledge, you can actually conditionally</span> <span data-start="683.76" data-end="686.64">force modern browsers to load modern JavaScript</span> <span data-start="686.89" data-end="688.97">and legacy browsers to load legacy JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="689.02" data-end="692.23">And this is a really nice schism that allows you to</span> <span data-start="693.06" data-end="695.98">have two bundles that really gives you the best of both</span> <span data-start="695.98" data-end="698.73">worlds. Where you can ship the smallest, fastest JavaScript</span> <span data-start="698.73" data-end="700.61">to modern browsers that support the most recent</span> <span data-start="700.61" data-end="703.61">capabilities like classes, like modules, all those sorts</span> <span data-start="703.61" data-end="706.87">of things. And you can leave an older legacy</span> <span data-start="706.87" data-end="709.29">bundle for browsers that don't have that kind of support.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="709.37" data-end="711.37">So we actually did this out of the box by default.</span> <span data-start="711.41" data-end="713.92">So you notice when we were doing those builds, we were</span> <span data-start="713.92" data-end="716.96">actually getting the two JavaScript bundles</span> <span data-start="717.17" data-end="719.76">for each of the files. So we had about-module-es2015.js and</span> <span data-start="719.76" data-end="720.76">we had about-module-es5.js.</span> <span data-start="721.63" data-end="723.68">And so, again, this is one of the changes that the Angular</span> <span data-start="724.72" data-end="727.39">team did behind the scenes without having to make you</span> <span data-start="727.39" data-end="729.14">change any of the code in your application.</span> <span data-start="729.18" data-end="731.22">And this is something we do every single release.</span> <span data-start="731.27" data-end="733.1">And so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna make our</span> <span data-start="733.1" data-end="735.65">application as fresh as possible so we can update to the</span> <span data-start="735.69" data-end="738.4">latest version of Angular and we're gonna automatically get</span> <span data-start="738.4" data-end="739.9">more improvements to our bundle size.</span> <span data-start="739.94" data-end="742.24">This is something that just happens every time you keep</span> <span data-start="742.24" data-end="744.4">your application up to date using Angular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="744.45" data-end="747.03">And so we're going to again, use the @angular/cli command</span> <span data-start="747.45" data-end="748.45">and we're going to use "ng update".</span> <span data-start="748.99" data-end="750.41">And we're going to update our application in a couple</span> <span data-start="750.45" data-end="752.7">stages. First, we're going to update the Angular</span> <span data-start="753.41" data-end="756.58">core packages. So core and the core</span> <span data-start="756.58" data-end="758.25">package, as well as the CLI package.</span> <span data-start="758.59" data-end="760">And then what we're gonna do is we're going to go and update</span> <span data-start="760" data-end="762.13">our dependencies. So we're gonna do it as two steps to make</span> <span data-start="762.13" data-end="765.3">sure that we don't accidentally enter a mistake or an error</span> <span data-start="765.38" data-end="767.34">where our application is no longer compatible with one of</span> <span data-start="767.39" data-end="769.55">those dependencies. So let's go ahead and get this started.</span> <span data-start="769.55" data-end="772.6">So I'm going to run "ng update" and what we're gonna do</span> <span data-start="772.6" data-end="775.81">is going to pass it angular/cli and angular/core.</span> <span data-start="776.65" data-end="779.23">Now, if you were on an even older version, what we do is we</span> <span data-start="779.23" data-end="781.94">recommend that you go one version at a time just so we can</span> <span data-start="781.94" data-end="783.07">apply things cleanly.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="783.61" data-end="785.28">And if you want to do that, for example, if you are in</span> <span data-start="785.28" data-end="787.61">version 6, you want to go to version 7, you just say "@7",</span> <span data-start="788.28" data-end="790.41">and that will just do it for you. But we're gonna go all</span> <span data-start="790.41" data-end="792.95">the way from version 8 up to version 9, which is the</span> <span data-start="793.2" data-end="795.87">latest. So I'm going to run this command and</span> <span data-start="796.25" data-end="797.79">theoretically things should work.</span> <span data-start="798.17" data-end="799.88">There's a few places where this might fail.</span> <span data-start="800.09" data-end="803.13">If your repository isn't clean, then what should happen is</span> <span data-start="803.13" data-end="804.67">we're gonna throw this warning, which is what we're seeing</span> <span data-start="804.67" data-end="806.47">right now. "Repository is not clean, please commit".</span> <span data-start="806.8" data-end="808.76">Because what we want is we want you to have a very clean</span> <span data-start="808.76" data-end="811.72">history so that you actually know what the Angular update</span> <span data-start="811.72" data-end="814.02">process did, because this isn't like a normal "ng update"</span> <span data-start="814.56" data-end="816.6">where we're just modifying the node modules of your</span> <span data-start="816.6" data-end="819.19">project. We're actually making changes to your application</span> <span data-start="819.48" data-end="821.36">so that you stay compatible with Angular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="822.36" data-end="824.11">And the reason we're able to do this is because the Angular</span> <span data-start="824.32" data-end="826.86">team at Google, we have thousands of projects across</span> <span data-start="827.61" data-end="830.28">Google that are not run by our team that are using Angular.</span> <span data-start="830.28" data-end="832.83">And it's actually, according to Google policy, our</span> <span data-start="832.83" data-end="835.7">responsibility for keeping those applications working as we</span> <span data-start="835.7" data-end="838.25">make breaking changes to Angular. And so, and only way that</span> <span data-start="838.25" data-end="840.29">we can scale is at Google is to build really great</span> <span data-start="840.33" data-end="841.75">automation and really great tooling.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="842.13" data-end="844.38">And so what we did is we baked that same sort of tooling</span> <span data-start="844.38" data-end="846.59">into the public world, into this "ng update" command.</span> <span data-start="846.63" data-end="848.84">So whenever we need to change a method name, whenever we</span> <span data-start="848.84" data-end="850.89">need to deprecate something, we're going to try and update</span> <span data-start="851.01" data-end="852.47">your application as best we can.</span> <span data-start="852.68" data-end="854.14">And so that's why we always make sure that you want to have</span> <span data-start="854.14" data-end="856.6">a clean history. So we'll just "git add" everything.</span> <span data-start="861.15" data-end="863.77">Commit that, and now we should be able to run our update</span> <span data-start="863.77" data-end="864.77">command.</span> <span data-start="867.82" data-end="869.36">So, again, what's happening behind the scenes?</span> <span data-start="869.65" data-end="872.03">It's going to be downloading and installing the latest</span> <span data-start="872.03" data-end="875.16">version of Angular CLI and then it's going to be updating</span> <span data-start="875.16" data-end="877.79">the packages in application and changing my code where</span> <span data-start="878.25" data-end="880.75">needed. And so if there's any sort of migrations what</span> <span data-start="880.75" data-end="882.79">should happen is while you're doing the update process,</span> <span data-start="883" data-end="885.59">it's going to report what migrations it's doing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="885.67" data-end="888.26">So you can see in your workspace migration, so it made a</span> <span data-start="888.26" data-end="889.97">few changes to the workspace layout.</span> <span data-start="890.01" data-end="891.76">So you can see it updated my angular.json file, it updated</span> <span data-start="891.84" data-end="894.35">my tsconfig.app, it updated the package.json.</span> <span data-start="894.55" data-end="897.1">And so it's making all of these migrations, even ones that</span> <span data-start="897.1" data-end="899.1">don't really have any changes to my app.</span> <span data-start="899.35" data-end="902.27">It's still double checking all those things so that we know</span> <span data-start="902.27" data-end="903.94">that my application is going to keep working.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="904.4" data-end="906.02">Now, there's a couple other places that you can look for</span> <span data-start="906.11" data-end="907.48">the latest information.</span> <span data-start="908.03" data-end="910.32">You'll notice here at the very, very bottom of the update,</span> <span data-start="910.9" data-end="912.95">it actually says "for more information, please see this</span> <span data-start="912.95" data-end="915.7">link". And so we actually have guides on what changes we're</span> <span data-start="915.7" data-end="917.95">making behind the scenes with every version of Angular, so</span> <span data-start="917.95" data-end="918.95">you can know about things like deprecations.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="919.5" data-end="921.79">You can know about things like removals and changes to the</span> <span data-start="921.79" data-end="922.87">way that the APIs work.</span> <span data-start="923.42" data-end="925.92">On the other one that I want to point you out to would be</span> <span data-start="926" data-end="927">update.angular.io.</span> <span data-start="928.3" data-end="930.51">So behind the scenes, when you ran "ng update", we made a</span> <span data-start="930.51" data-end="932.68">lot of changes to your project. And so, if you actually</span> <span data-start="932.68" data-end="935.47">wanted to see what you need to do, you can just go to the</span> <span data-start="935.64" data-end="937.22">update guide. And you can say "show me how to update".</span> <span data-start="937.26" data-end="939.89">And we'll say, "Oh, make sure you're on the latest version</span> <span data-start="939.89" data-end="941.23">here. Make sure using this version of node".</span> <span data-start="941.77" data-end="943.6">It walks you through the changes that are going to affect</span> <span data-start="943.6" data-end="946.65">you as a developer. And you can even tune this based on the</span> <span data-start="946.77" data-end="949.03">number and amount of features and the depth and complexity</span> <span data-start="949.03" data-end="950.03">of your usage of Angular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="950.32" data-end="952.74">Because most applications don't care about all of</span> <span data-start="953.28" data-end="955.57">the changes we're making under the hood. But let's say you</span> <span data-start="955.66" data-end="957.28">have a large application, you have several hundred</span> <span data-start="957.28" data-end="958.74">components. You have component libraries.</span> <span data-start="958.74" data-end="959.87">You're using things like Universal.</span> <span data-start="960.12" data-end="961.37">You can check these boxes.</span> <span data-start="961.71" data-end="964.04">And what we'll do is we'll show you all of the information</span> <span data-start="964.04" data-end="965.75">about the update, all of the changes we're making behind</span> <span data-start="965.75" data-end="968.29">the scenes. So you can have a full, complete understanding</span> <span data-start="968.29" data-end="970.67">what's going on. And the other way you can do it, is if you</span> <span data-start="970.67" data-end="973.3">just take a look at the git history, you can now go in and</span> <span data-start="973.3" data-end="974.93">see what all the changes we made were.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="974.93" data-end="977.39">So, for example, when we move to version 9, we turned on</span> <span data-start="977.47" data-end="980.39">ahead-of-time compilation by default.</span> <span data-start="980.39" data-end="982.48">So that's gonna make your build a lot faster.</span> <span data-start="982.52" data-end="984.98">You can see that we've installed all the dependencies.</span> <span data-start="985.31" data-end="987.31">And not just on Angular, we've also installed things like</span> <span data-start="987.36" data-end="988.65">rxjs to the latest version.</span> <span data-start="989.57" data-end="992.07">We've updated your components so that they actually</span> <span data-start="992.15" data-end="993.86">continue working as we make changes to Angular.</span> <span data-start="994.45" data-end="995.57">So this is really, really powerful.</span> <span data-start="995.86" data-end="998.91">And then we can actually do a test to see if this works.</span> <span data-start="998.95" data-end="1002.04">Let's just run "ng serve" and we can say, "Yes,</span> <span data-start="1002.45" data-end="1005.12">let's let Google Analytics track some of our CLI usage</span> <span data-start="1005.21" data-end="1006.21">anonymously".</span> <span data-start="1007.08" data-end="1009.54">And what will happen is when we return back to the browser</span> <span data-start="1009.54" data-end="1011.84">window, we're gonna get the latest version of Angular and</span> <span data-start="1011.84" data-end="1013.72">our app is generally just gonna keep working.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1014.51" data-end="1017.26">And then the way that this really affects you is not only</span> <span data-start="1017.26" data-end="1019.05">keeping you up to date as a developer, making sure using</span> <span data-start="1019.05" data-end="1021.35">best practices, but again, it's also going to improve the</span> <span data-start="1021.35" data-end="1022.47">performance of your application.</span> <span data-start="1022.89" data-end="1025.31">One of the things that you're going to see is</span> <span data-start="1026.31" data-end="1028.1">every time we make an update to Angular we're trying to</span> <span data-start="1028.1" data-end="1030.32">look for ways to making your more tree shakeable, to make</span> <span data-start="1030.48" data-end="1031.48">your build system better.</span> <span data-start="1031.94" data-end="1034.03">And so there's lots of experimentation, lots of ideation</span> <span data-start="1034.03" data-end="1036.78">going on there because the state of bundlers in JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1036.99" data-end="1039.78">are not static. Webpack keeps getting better, Rollup keeps</span> <span data-start="1039.95" data-end="1041.49">getting better, terser keeps getting better.</span> <span data-start="1041.74" data-end="1043.87">And these tools are changing, and they're evolving and the</span> <span data-start="1043.87" data-end="1045.33">way that they relate to each other is changing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1045.33" data-end="1047.67">And so what we do is as the Angular team, we're trying to</span> <span data-start="1047.67" data-end="1049.04">stay on top of that for you.</span> <span data-start="1049.33" data-end="1051.34">And so let's go ahead and refresh.</span> <span data-start="1051.71" data-end="1054.46">And if we take a look in the DevTools, we should see we are</span> <span data-start="1054.46" data-end="1056.8">now on the latest version of Angular so 9.1.9 at the</span> <span data-start="1057.72" data-end="1059.68">ready. But whenever you use "ng update", it's just gonna</span> <span data-start="1059.68" data-end="1061.43">move you to the latest version. It's gonna do that</span> <span data-start="1061.51" data-end="1064.14">automatically for you so that you are staying up to date.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1064.22" data-end="1065.77">Staying fresh. Staying fast.</span> <span data-start="1066.39" data-end="1068.19">So once you've updated Angular and you've updated the CLI.</span> <span data-start="1070.15" data-end="1071.9">Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and update all the</span> <span data-start="1071.9" data-end="1074.4">other packages. So if you take a look, for example,</span> <span data-start="1075.24" data-end="1078.49">we did not in our package.json, we didn't update</span> <span data-start="1078.91" data-end="1080.57">the CDK or we didn't update @angular/material.</span> <span data-start="1081.16" data-end="1083.33">So we're going to do one more "ng update" command</span> <span data-start="1084.58" data-end="1086.16">to update @angular/material and @angular/cdk.</span> <span data-start="1087.04" data-end="1088.54">You can do with any of your dependencies.</span> <span data-start="1088.58" data-end="1090.58">A lot of dependencies are starting to support these</span> <span data-start="1090.83" data-end="1092.79">automatic migrations. This is something we've been pushing</span> <span data-start="1093.13" data-end="1094.75">very hard for in the ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="1106.64" data-end="1108.14">Let's just run that "ng update @angular/material</span> <span data-start="1108.14" data-end="1109.73">@angular/cdk" command again.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1110.31" data-end="1112.02">And again, it's fetching the latest version of those</span> <span data-start="1112.02" data-end="1113.77">packages. It's updating their dependencies in your</span> <span data-start="1113.82" data-end="1116.4">package.json. And then it's going to execute any migrations</span> <span data-start="1116.57" data-end="1118.95">that you need to be on the latest version.</span> <span data-start="1122.32" data-end="1124.7">And I think we're just going to run "ng serve" one last</span> <span data-start="1124.7" data-end="1127.33">time and we will see that our entire application kept on</span> <span data-start="1127.33" data-end="1130.29">working and our bundle size should have gotten a little bit</span> <span data-start="1130.29" data-end="1133.59">better. Then again, it's doing a little bit of compiling</span> <span data-start="1133.63" data-end="1136.34">ahead of time. Generally, this is a temporary thing that</span> <span data-start="1136.42" data-end="1139.3">you're going to see with Ivy and with version 9, so we do</span> <span data-start="1139.3" data-end="1140.3">this extra compilation.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1140.8" data-end="1143.26">That's really to offer the latest version of Angular and</span> <span data-start="1143.3" data-end="1145.1">the latest features of Angular while still staying</span> <span data-start="1145.1" data-end="1146.97">compatible with the rest of the ecosystem.</span> <span data-start="1147.06" data-end="1150.02">So this is just a extra compilation step the Angular</span> <span data-start="1150.23" data-end="1151.9">team does to optimize things.</span> <span data-start="1154.36" data-end="1156.32">All right. As soon as this completion is complete, what</span> <span data-start="1156.32" data-end="1158.19">we're gonna see is we're going to be on the latest version</span> <span data-start="1158.19" data-end="1160.74">of Angular. And again, we updated the package.json.</span> <span data-start="1161.28" data-end="1163.62">So just all the dependencies, including removing</span> <span data-start="1164.41" data-end="1167.24">things like hammer.js and our application should just keep</span> <span data-start="1167.41" data-end="1168.62">working. Yep. There it is.</span> <span data-start="1168.95" data-end="1169.95">We have a great</span> <span data-start="1172.12" data-end="1174.08">dashboard, just like we had before right in the beginning.</span> <span data-start="1174.08" data-end="1175.25">Everything works, everything animates.</span> <span data-start="1175.92" data-end="1176.92">We're now on the latest version of Angular.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1177.5" data-end="1179.51">We're now in the latest version material and the CDK.</span> <span data-start="1179.84" data-end="1182.38">And our application is as fast as we can be because we're</span> <span data-start="1182.59" data-end="1184.51">budgeting. We're making sure that we're understanding our</span> <span data-start="1184.55" data-end="1186.43">application, making sure it doesn't grow over time.</span> <span data-start="1186.93" data-end="1189.64">We're analyzing the application bundle size with source</span> <span data-start="1189.64" data-end="1192.44">maps. And we're doing things like lazy loading so that we</span> <span data-start="1192.64" data-end="1194.98">only make users pay for the features that they're using at</span> <span data-start="1194.98" data-end="1195.98">the current time.</span> <span data-start="1196.4" data-end="1198.19">That's going to be it for us. Thank you so much for</span> </p>
