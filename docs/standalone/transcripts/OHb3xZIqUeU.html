on a mobile</span> <span data-start="266.76" data-end="267.93">device out and</span> <span data-start="267.93" data-end="269.52">so I just thought let's just try this</span> <span data-start="269.52" data-end="270.66">and see what happens so I'm gonna hit</span> <span data-start="270.66" data-end="272.91">record I'm gonna hit command shift are</span> <span data-start="272.91" data-end="277.65">to do a reload okay and I'm gonna stop</span> <span data-start="277.65" data-end="281.46">and we can discuss what we see okay let</span> <span data-start="281.46" data-end="284.699">me just wrap this up here now the first</span> <span data-start="284.699" data-end="287.16">thing to notice I suppose would be the</span> <span data-start="287.16" data-end="291.12">timings row here to have to remind</span> <span data-start="291.12" data-end="292.59">ourselves what these are Dom content</span> <span data-start="292.59" data-end="293.97">loaded this has been around forever</span> <span data-start="293.97" data-end="297.289">hasn't it yeah but there is first paint</span> <span data-start="297.289" data-end="300.419">first content for paint first meaningful</span> <span data-start="300.419" data-end="301.65">paint which we could talk about a little</span> <span data-start="301.65" data-end="303.51">bit I suppose largest content for</span> <span data-start="303.51" data-end="304.49">painting you can see this actually</span> <span data-start="304.49" data-end="307.289">highlighted our screenshot here and then</span> <span data-start="307.289" data-end="310.11">the load event now I can use the keys on</span> <span data-start="310.11" data-end="314.4">the keyboard to come into a little bit</span> <span data-start="314.4" data-end="315.87">closer zoom in a little bit on this</span> <span data-start="315.87" data-end="318.72">particular area of interest and you see</span> <span data-start="318.72" data-end="321.69">here I suppose the first content for</span> <span data-start="321.69" data-end="327.06">paint is presumably happening and then</span> <span data-start="327.06" data-end="328.53">the largest content for paint is</span> <span data-start="328.53" data-end="330.449">happening slightly later that's right</span> <span data-start="330.449" data-end="331.889">now I think we can get a little bit more</span> <span data-start="331.889" data-end="334.199">info about this because first content</span> <span data-start="334.199" data-end="335.729">for paint is happening and then the</span> <span data-start="335.729" data-end="337.139">largest content for paper which implies</span> <span data-start="337.139" data-end="340.52">to me that the image is coming in after</span> <span data-start="340.52" data-end="342.99">the initial page content so we're</span> <span data-start="342.99" data-end="344.19">drawing something we're painting</span> <span data-start="344.19" data-end="346.26">something and then we're painting the</span> <span data-start="346.26" data-end="348.21">image after the fact so let's just even</span> <span data-start="348.21" data-end="351.84">do that with screenshots on mm-hm and we</span> <span data-start="351.84" data-end="355.849">will record again and see what we get</span> <span data-start="355.849" data-end="361.56">okay I'll stop there and hopefully I</span> <span data-start="361.56" data-end="365.37">just leave this a little bit and we</span> <span data-start="365.37" data-end="368.05">might see</span> <span data-start="368.06" data-end="374.07">okay so roundabout fact I wonder if I</span> <span data-start="374.07" data-end="375.69">can just bring this in a little bit</span> <span data-start="375.69" data-end="379.26">further let me just see if I can drag</span> <span data-start="379.26" data-end="382.5">that down throw this a little bit okay</span> <span data-start="382.5" data-end="384.539">that might be as clear as this is gonna</span> <span data-start="384.539" data-end="387.05">get I wonder</span> <span data-start="387.05" data-end="389.82">yeah it is okay I tell you what we're</span> <span data-start="389.82" data-end="390.99">gonna do we're going to make this a</span> <span data-start="390.99" data-end="392.31">little bit clearer because what's</span> <span data-start="392.31" data-end="393.63">happening is we're actually seeing the</span> <span data-start="393.63" data-end="396.06">page content before I did the refresh</span> <span data-start="396.06" data-end="398.219">and then slightly after so I can do I</span> <span data-start="398.219" data-end="400.08">can if I take this and I go to about</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="401.58">blank mr. sheean</span> <span data-start="401.58" data-end="403.05">testing way to do this testing if you're</span> <span data-start="403.05" data-end="405.81">ever curious about it record it from</span> <span data-start="405.81" data-end="408.569">about blank so that you start without</span> <span data-start="408.569" data-end="410.37">anything on the page can that can make</span> <span data-start="410.37" data-end="412.349">it easier to find your screenshot so I'm</span> <span data-start="412.349" data-end="416.699">gonna go paste in the URL here but not</span>

data-end="837.339">layout shift or CLS for short is a</span> <span data-start="837.339" data-end="839.13">metric that tries to capture the</span> <span data-start="839.13" data-end="841.81">experience

<span data-start="853.24" data-end="854.74">you tap on it it shifts out from</span> <span data-start="854.74" data-end="856">underneath you it's a very frustrating</span> <span data-start="856"

data-start="873.959" data-end="877.779">so cumulative layout shift is a metric</span> <span data-start="877.779" data-end="879.579">that attempts to quantify that</span> <span data-start="879.579" data-end="882.94">experience and so there's a couple</span> <span data-start="882.94" data-end="885.42">pieces there but a layout shift is</span> <span data-start="885.42" data-end="889.27">anytime an

will happen</span> <span data-start="894.97" data-end="896.38">like in this case that we just saw an</span> <span data-start="896.38" data-end="899.41">image loads in and it pushes the text</span> <span data-start="899.41" data-end="902.02">below it down and so the image that the</span> <span data-start="902.02" data-end="903.459">layout shift was not on the image the</span> <span

data-end="921.22">explain but the CLS</span> <span data-start="921.22" data-end="924.339">is a measure of both how much of the</span> <span data-start="924.339" data-end="926.23">page content moved

what that roughly translates to over</span> <span data-start="1667.54" data-end="1669.34">here is when we zoom in on these</span> <span data-start="1669.34" data-end="1672.28">top-level tasks which

data-end="1684.1">it's it's gonna contribute to the the</span> <span data-start="1684.1" data-end="1685.69">blocking time right because what we want</span> <span data-start="1685.69" data-end="1687.31">to do is we want to keep a track on on</span> <span data-start="1687.31" data-end="1689.98">tasks that that go over 50 milliseconds</span> <span data-start="1689.98"

data-end="1718.9">just out of curiosity some people asked</span> <span data-start="1718.9" data-end="1721.51">why you know why 50 milliseconds what's</span> <span data-start="1721.51" data-end="1724.21">the thinking behind that yes</span> <span data-start="1724.21" data-end="1727.03">the answer is that the idea you might</span> <span data-start="1727.03" data-end="1728.89">have heard of rail the rail performance</span> <span data-start="1728.89" data-end="1730.54">model and you've heard often times</span> <span data-start="1730.54" data-end="1731.71">people say you should

<span data-start="1736.48" data-end="1737.98">milliseconds to the blocking time and</span> <span data-start="1737.98" data-end="1739.81">the idea there is that if you ever have</span> <span data-start="1739.81" data-end="1742.78">if you keep all of your tasks below 50</span> <span data-start="1742.78" data-end="1744.13">milliseconds then there's never</span> <span data-start="1744.13" data-end="1747.04">situation where two tasks can't both run</span> <span data-start="1747.04" data-end="1750.13">within the 100 millisecond threshold and</span> <span data-start="1750.13" data-end="1751.84">so that's kind of if people are</span> <span data-start="1751.84" data-end="1753.49">wondering why that 50 millisecond time</span> <span data-start="1753.49" data-end="1755.5">exists and why we chose that for the the</span> <span data-start="1755.5" data-end="1758.34">magic number with total blocking time</span> <span data-start="1758.34" data-end="1761.11">exactly and of course if you were doing</span> <span data-start="1761.11" data-end="1764.08">an animation then your task time really</span> <span data-start="1764.08" data-end="1766.03">should be under like 10 or — that's</span> <span data-start="1766.03" data-end="1768.82">irregular seconds so so we'd sort of it</span> <span data-start="1768.82" data-end="1770.89">you got to be context aware the 50</span> <span data-start="1770.89" data-end="1772.33">milliseconds number is a it's a great</span> <span data-start="1772.33"
