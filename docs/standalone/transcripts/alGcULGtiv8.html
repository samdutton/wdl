<p><span data-start="43.85" data-end="45.14">But first, a disclaimer.</span> <span data-start="45.22" data-end="48.02">This video is about best practice</span> <span data-start="48.23" data-end="50.9">for simple sign-in forms that use an email address and</span> <span data-start="51.06" data-end="54.36">password. It doesn't explain how to use federated</span> <span data-start="54.36" data-end="57.49">log-in with identity providers like Google or Facebook,</span> <span data-start="57.82" data-end="60.24">or how to integrate with backend services.</span> <span data-start="60.78" data-end="63.62">You can find out more about those topics from the links at</span> <span data-start="63.74" data-end="66.04">the end of the article that goes with this video.</span> <span data-start="67.12" data-end="70.46">So in this video, I'm going to talk about straightforward</span> <span data-start="70.46" data-end="73.71">frontend coding best practice, mostly</span> <span data-start="73.75" data-end="77.3">HTML, with a little bit of CSS and some JavaScript.</span> <span data-start="78.38" data-end="81.51">I asked the Identity team at Chrome what I should talk</span> <span data-start="81.51" data-end="84.72">about. And they said, get the basics of</span> <span data-start="85.1" data-end="86.64">sign-in forms right.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="87.06" data-end="89.43">So be warned, this is simple stuff.</span> <span data-start="89.48" data-end="90.69">It's not rocket science.</span> <span data-start="91.44" data-end="94.11">And before we start, a quick reality check, you know, do</span> <span data-start="94.11" data-end="96.61">you actually really need users to sign in to</span> <span data-start="97.07" data-end="100.28">your site? People don't like being forced</span> <span data-start="100.4" data-end="103.57">to hand over identity information, and all that personal</span> <span data-start="103.57" data-end="106.62">data and the code that goes with it becomes a cost</span> <span data-start="106.74" data-end="108.37">and a liability for you.</span> <span data-start="108.83" data-end="111.58">If people can use your site without signing in,</span> <span data-start="111.79" data-end="114.38">all the better. The best sign-in form is no sign-in form</span> <span data-start="115.13" data-end="118.25">at all. Anyway, with all that out of the way, let's</span> <span data-start="118.25" data-end="119.26">get on with it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="120.05" data-end="123.05">First up, well formed HTML is the</span> <span data-start="123.05" data-end="125.76">backbone of a good sign-in experience.</span> <span data-start="126.14" data-end="127.93">Use the elements built for the job.</span> <span data-start="128.22" data-end="131.39">They've been around for years: , , ,</span> <span data-start="131.48" data-end="132.48">and .</span> <span data-start="132.77" data-end="135.65">And as I'll show you, using these elements as intended</span> <span data-start="135.98" data-end="138.32">enables built-in browser functionality, improves</span> <span data-start="138.94" data-end="141.95">accessibility and adds meaning to your markup.</span> <span data-start="142.57" data-end="144.82">Your basic HTML might start out something like</span> <span data-start="145.53" data-end="146.53">this.</span> <span data-start="148.54" data-end="149.62">So let's break that down.</span> <span data-start="150.33" data-end="153.42">Now, you might be tempted to just wrap inputs</span> <span data-start="153.54" data-end="157.04">in a and handle input data submission</span> <span data-start="157.13" data-end="158.46">purely with JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="158.75" data-end="159.88">Well, don't do it!</span> <span data-start="160.09" data-end="163.17">You know, it's just generally better to use a plain</span> <span data-start="163.26" data-end="164.55">old element.</span> <span data-start="165.05" data-end="167.76">This makes your site more accessible to screenreaders</span> <span data-start="168.26" data-end="171.64">and other assistive devices and helps browsers</span> <span data-start="171.68" data-end="174.85">understand the intention of your code to enable a whole</span> <span data-start="174.85" data-end="177.69">lot of cross platform standardized built-in form</span> <span data-start="177.94" data-end="179.32">features that I'll show you later.</span> <span data-start="180.98" data-end="184.15">An HTML form also makes it simpler to build basic</span> <span data-start="184.15" data-end="186.16">functional sign-in for older browsers and</span> <span data-start="187.28" data-end="189.03">to enable sign-in even if JavaScript</span> <span data-start="190.29" data-end="191.29">fails.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="193.16" data-end="194.16">So, first things first.</span> <span data-start="194.66" data-end="197.17">To label an input, use a .</span> <span data-start="197.58" data-end="199.04">There are two reasons for that.</span> <span data-start="199.5" data-end="202.63">First reason: a tap or a click on a label moves</span> <span data-start="202.63" data-end="204.97">focus to the input it's associated with.</span> <span data-start="205.55" data-end="208.47">Second reason, screenreaders announced label text</span> <span data-start="208.72" data-end="211.68">when the label or the labels input gets focus.</span> <span data-start="212.97" data-end="214.02">Sign in, heading one.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="215.14" data-end="216.14">Email with hint.</span> <span data-start="216.85" data-end="219.65">You associate a label with an input by giving the label's</span> <span data-start="219.73" data-end="222.65">'for' attribute the same value as the input's id.</span> <span data-start="224.94" data-end="228.32">Now, placeholders can be useful, but don't</span> <span data-start="228.41" data-end="230.49">use them as input labels.</span> <span data-start="231.03" data-end="233.7">People are liable to forget what the input was for once</span> <span data-start="233.91" data-end="236.62">they've started entering text, especially if they get</span> <span data-start="236.62" data-end="239.83">distracted. You know, was I entering an email address,</span> <span data-start="239.83" data-end="241.54">a phone number, or an account ID?</span> <span data-start="242.13" data-end="243.13">I can't remember!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.92" data-end="246.09">There are other potential problems with placeholders.</span> <span data-start="247.22" data-end="250.22">And you can see the article that goes with this video</span> <span data-start="251.01" data-end="252.14">if you're unconvinced.</span> <span data-start="253.39" data-end="256.56">Now, it's probably best to put your labels above</span> <span data-start="256.56" data-end="257.56">your inputs.</span> <span data-start="257.81" data-end="260.81">This enables consistent design across mobile and</span> <span data-start="260.81" data-end="263.98">desktop, and according to Google AI research,</span> <span data-start="264.32" data-end="266.44">enables quicker scanning by users.</span> <span data-start="266.86" data-end="269.7">You get full width labels and inputs and you don't need to</span> <span data-start="269.86" data-end="272.78">adjust label and input width to fit the label text.</span> <span data-start="275.33" data-end="278.41">Some sites force users to enter emails or passwords</span> <span data-start="278.46" data-end="280.46">twice. That might reduce errors for a few</span> <span data-start="281.63" data-end="284.67">users, but causes extra work for all</span> <span data-start="284.67" data-end="287.67">users and can increase abandonment rates.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="288.68" data-end="291.51">I think it's better to enable users to confirm their email</span> <span data-start="291.59" data-end="294.72">address, you'll need to do that anyway, and make</span> <span data-start="294.72" data-end="297.35">it easy for them to reset that password.</span> <span data-start="297.98" data-end="300.4">Next. Use for buttons!</span> <span data-start="300.9" data-end="303.19">Button elements provide accessible behavior and</span> <span data-start="303.98" data-end="306.94">built-in form submission functionality and they</span> <span data-start="306.94" data-end="308.11">can easily be styled.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="308.82" data-end="311.49">There's no point in using a or some other element</span> <span data-start="311.66" data-end="312.87">pretending to be a button.</span> <span data-start="313.99" data-end="317">Give the submit button in a sign-up or sign-in form a</span> <span data-start="317" data-end="320.37">value that says what it does, such as "create</span> <span data-start="320.37" data-end="321.37">account" or "sign-in".</span> <span data-start="322.04" data-end="324.79">Not "submit" or "start", or whatever.</span> <span data-start="325.75" data-end="329.01">Considered disabling the sign-in button once the user</span> <span data-start="329.01" data-end="330.47">has tapped or clicked it.</span> <span data-start="331.05" data-end="334.01">Many users click buttons multiple times, even</span> <span data-start="334.01" data-end="336.31">on sites that are fast and responsive.</span> <span data-start="336.72" data-end="339.39">That slows down interactions and can add to server</span> <span data-start="339.73" data-end="340.73">load.</span> <span data-start="341.27" data-end="344.44">Conversely, don't disable form submission awaiting user</span> <span data-start="344.44" data-end="347.44">input. For example, like, don't just disable the sign-in</span> <span data-start="347.82" data-end="350.49">button if something's missing or in the wrong format.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="351.45" data-end="354.24">Explain to the user what they need to do.</span> <span data-start="355.07" data-end="357.87">This is a real example. I was urgently trying to sign-in to</span> <span data-start="358.29" data-end="360.46">a site, and there was no way of knowing what</span> <span data-start="361.37" data-end="362.37">I was doing wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="362.87" data-end="365.75">Now that HTML code I showed you before</span> <span data-start="365.88" data-end="368.76">is all valid and correct, but</span> <span data-start="368.88" data-end="372.05">the default browser styling means it looks</span> <span data-start="372.05" data-end="375.26">terrible and it's hard to use, especially on mobile.</span> <span data-start="375.93" data-end="378.22">The default browser size for just about everything to do</span> <span data-start="378.26" data-end="381.48">with forms is too small, especially on mobile.</span> <span data-start="382.14" data-end="384.69">This might seem obvious, but you know it's a common problem</span> <span data-start="384.69" data-end="386.65">with sign-in forms on lots of sites.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="387.02" data-end="390.28">In particular, the default size and padding for inputs</span> <span data-start="390.36" data-end="393.36">and buttons is too small on desktop, and</span> <span data-start="393.4" data-end="394.57">even worse on mobile.</span> <span data-start="395.53" data-end="398.37">Here you can see the various minimum guidelines for target</span> <span data-start="398.45" data-end="401.54">sizes. On that basis, I reckon you should add</span> <span data-start="401.58" data-end="403.75">at least about 15 pixels of padding to input</span> <span data-start="404.67" data-end="407.42">elements and buttons for mobile and around 10 px</span> <span data-start="407.71" data-end="410.34">on desktop. But don't take my word for it.</span> <span data-start="410.38" data-end="413.51">Try this out with real devices and real</span> <span data-start="413.51" data-end="416.8">humans. And also make sure to provide enough</span> <span data-start="416.8" data-end="418.43">space between inputs.</span> <span data-start="419.06" data-end="422.23">Add enough margin to make inputs work well as touch</span> <span data-start="422.23" data-end="424.56">targets. As a rough guide, that's about a finger</span> <span data-start="425.31" data-end="426.31">width of margin.</span> <span data-start="427.06" data-end="429.82">You should comfortably be able to tap each of your inputs</span> <span data-start="430.23" data-end="432.74">and buttons without bumping into something else.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="434.15" data-end="437.2">You also need to make sure your inputs are clearly visible.</span> <span data-start="437.37" data-end="439.95">Now the default border styling for inputs makes them hard</span> <span data-start="439.95" data-end="443.12">to see. They're almost invisible on some platforms, such</span> <span data-start="443.12" data-end="444.41">as Chrome for Android.</span> <span data-start="445.46" data-end="446.79">So add a border.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.29" data-end="450.5">On a white background, a good general rule is to use a</span> <span data-start="450.92" data-end="454.09">#ccc or darker. Or change the background color</span> <span data-start="454.13" data-end="457.47">instead. I mean, whatever you do, make it blindingly</span> <span data-start="457.47" data-end="459.55">obvious where to tap or click.</span> <span data-start="459.97" data-end="462.97">And remember, design for thumbs.</span> <span data-start="463.6" data-end="465.52">If you search for "touch target", you'll see lots of</span> <span data-start="465.52" data-end="467.02">pictures of forefingers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="467.31" data-end="470.06">However, in the real world, most people, many people use</span> <span data-start="470.44" data-end="472.32">their thumbs to interact with phones.</span> <span data-start="472.86" data-end="476.11">Thumbs are bigger than forefingers, and control is less</span> <span data-start="476.11" data-end="477.11">precise.</span> <span data-start="477.57" data-end="480.53">All the more reason for adequately sized touch targets.</span> <span data-start="481.58" data-end="484.45">Now, as with form control dimensions and padding,</span> <span data-start="484.75" data-end="487.29">the default browser font size for input elements and</span> <span data-start="487.67" data-end="490.21">buttons is too small, particularly on mobile.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="490.71" data-end="493.92">Browsers on different platforms size fonts somewhat</span> <span data-start="493.92" data-end="496.59">differently. So it's difficult to specify a particular font</span> <span data-start="496.59" data-end="498.22">size that works well everywhere.</span> <span data-start="499.18" data-end="502.43">A quick survey of popular websites shows sizes of</span> <span data-start="502.68" data-end="505.22">around 13 to 16 px on desktop.</span> <span data-start="505.93" data-end="508.6">Well, matching that physical size is a good minimum for</span> <span data-start="508.85" data-end="510.1">text on mobile.</span> <span data-start="510.56" data-end="513.11">And that means you need to use larger pixel sizes on</span> <span data-start="513.52" data-end="516.94">mobile, generally. 16 px on Chrome on desktop</span> <span data-start="517.32" data-end="519.53">is quite legible, but even if you have pretty</span> <span data-start="520.37" data-end="523.2">good vision, it's difficult to read 16 px</span> <span data-start="523.33" data-end="525.33">text on Chrome on Android.</span> <span data-start="525.7" data-end="528.5">Lighthouse can help you automate the process of detecting</span> <span data-start="529.04" data-end="530.92">text that's too small.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="531.46" data-end="534.42">Now let's talk about visual indicators for validation.</span> <span data-start="535.09" data-end="537.42">Browsers have built-in features to do basic form</span> <span data-start="538.13" data-end="540.76">validation for inputs with a type attribute.</span> <span data-start="541.55" data-end="544.51">Browsers warn when you submit a form with an input</span> <span data-start="544.51" data-end="547.18">value and set focus on the problematic input.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="547.68" data-end="549.23">You don't need to use JavaScript!</span> <span data-start="550.69" data-end="554.02">Use the :invalid CSS selector to highlight</span> <span data-start="554.02" data-end="554.98">invalid data.</span> <span data-start="555.65" data-end="558.24">This is really widely supported by browsers</span> <span data-start="558.65" data-end="560.78">and for more recent browsers, you can use</span> <span data-start="560.86" data-end="563.95">:not(:placeholder-shown) to avoid selecting</span> <span data-start="563.95" data-end="565.74">inputs with no content.</span> <span data-start="566.04" data-end="569.12">Okay. We've touched on elements and a bit of CSS.</span> <span data-start="569.5" data-end="572.13">Now I want to talk about attributes.</span> <span data-start="572.88" data-end="575.29">This is where the magic really happens.</span> <span data-start="575.34" data-end="577.96">Browsers have multiple helpful built-in</span> <span data-start="578.42" data-end="581.63">features that use element attributes.</span> <span data-start="581.88" data-end="582.89">So let's take a look.</span> <span data-start="584.26" data-end="586.93">Add an 'autofocus' attribute to the first input in your</span> <span data-start="587.18" data-end="590.23">sign-in form.
