these are all designed to help you</span> <span data-start="72.57" data-end="74.13">improve the user experience in your</span> <span data-start="74.13" data-end="77.61">sites and your apps but not all

data-end="89.159">you typically test in a lab setting</span> <span data-start="89.159" data-end="90.36">something you do more with the field</span> <span data-start="90.36" data-end="93.45">with like

been</span> <span data-start="96.54" data-end="99.36">trying to get into the performance panel</span> <span data-start="99.36" data-end="102.78">inside of dev tools so because once your</span> <span

data-start="106.92" data-end="108.509">a real user after mechanically so from</span> <span data-start="108.509" data-end="109.799">dev tools and quickly do with the</span> <span data-start="109.799" data-end="112.14">measurement the second you need EV tools</span> <span data-start="112.14" data-end="113.64">to measure something you're in a lab</span> <span data-start="113.64" data-end="115.35">yeah and so our assumption is</span> <span data-start="115.35" data-end="117.42">predominately if your local host on your</span> <span data-start="117.42" data-end="119.399">machine we tend to refer to that as the</span> <span data-start="119.399" data-end="122.43">lab setting so let me just run you</span> <span data-start="122.43" data-end="124.439">through very quickly the kinds of things</span> <span data-start="124.439" data-end="127.11">we've got so if I just if I go to the</span> <span data-start="127.11" data-end="128.759">web dev home page and I've got the</span> <span data-start="128.759" data-end="131.58">performance tab open here in chrome this</span> <span data-start="131.58" data-end="133.74">is Ernie in canary so</span> <span data-start="133.74" data-end="136.65">some of these features are very kind of</span> <span data-start="136.65" data-end="138.51">hot off the press they're subject to</span> <span data-start="138.51" data-end="140.04">change so just bear that in mind if</span> <span data-start="140.04" data-end="141.42">these things look a little bit different</span> <span data-start="141.42" data-end="143.25">over the coming weeks and months it's</span> <span data-start="143.25" data-end="144.33">because we're working on them we just</span> <span data-start="144.33" data-end="145.44">wanted to share them with you because</span> <span data-start="145.44" data-end="147.18">we're kind of excited about some of them</span> <span data-start="147.18" data-end="149.19">and all them we want to show them to you</span> <span data-start="149.19" data-end="151.2">so if I take a recording so I've been</span> <span data-start="151.2" data-end="152.73">about to record I'm going to hit in my</span> <span data-start="152.73" data-end="154.41">case command shift R which will do a</span> <span data-start="154.41"

and it's gonna</span> <span data-start="170.55" data-end="173.97">process that okay so let me bring that</span> <span data-start="173.97" data-end="177.69">down so this I mean this is actually a</span> <span data-start="177.69" data-end="179.64">really good trace recording like a</span> <span data-start="179.64" data-end="180.66">performance recording if you've got</span> <span data-start="180.66" data-end="182.58">something like this in the lab setting</span> <span data-start="182.58" data-end="184.23">you can be super happy and the reason is</span> <span

data-end="522.36">frustrating and so we're starting to</span> <span data-start="522.36" data-end="524.79">give you the ways and the means of</span> <span data-start="524.79" data-end="527.7">tracking

into this</span> <span data-start="531.81" data-end="534.06">experience track so there's some stuff</span> <span data-start="534.06" data-end="534.75">about</span> <span data-start="534.75" data-end="536.28">boring which if you read the</span> <span data-start="536.28" data-end="537.72">documentation on cumulative layout</span> <span data-start="537.72" data-end="539.73">shifts I will explain the scoring a</span> <span data-start="539.73" data-end="541.29">little bit more to you and you can also</span> <span data-start="541.29" data-end="542.88">see whether or not it was in response to</span> <span data-start="542.88" data-end="545.88">some recent user input we also include</span> <span data-start="545.88" data-end="547.71">some location information where you went</span>

data-start="559.65" data-end="560.97">is it's probably this privacy reminder</span> <span data-start="560.97" data-end="564.12">here that is coming on here now one of</span> <span data-start="564.12" data-end="565.76">the things that we probably need to add</span> <span data-start="565.76" data-end="569.97">is which elements it is specifically and</span> <span data-start="569.97" data-end="571.68">there is that information in the trace</span> <span data-start="571.68" data-end="573.36">it's just a case of plumbing it through</span> <span data-start="573.36" data-end="574.71">so that's actually something that I'm</span> <span data-start="574.71" data-end="575.94">going to hopefully look at so maybe by</span> <span data-start="575.94" data-end="578.94">the time you see this video go and have</span> <span data-start="578.94" data-end="581.79">a look in Chrome Canary possibly we've</span> <span data-start="581.79" data-end="585.03">got the elements there

<span data-start="589.05" data-end="591.08">the film strip and actually see</span> <span data-start="591.08" data-end="593.01">something shipped and that might be a</span> <span data-start="593.01" data-end="595.5">good way to work around that until dev</span> <span data-start="595.5" data-end="597.18">tools can yeah that's a great way of</span> <span data-start="597.18" data-end="599.61">doing it often I think when it's your</span> <span data-start="599.61" data-end="602.82">own code you have a fair sense of what's</span> <span data-start="602.82" data-end="605.07">likely to be moving around and the thing</span> <span data-start="605.07" data-end="607.62">to bear in mind is layout shifts do</span> <span data-start="607.62" data-end="610.74">cause problem are problematic UX and so</span> <span data-start="610.74" data-end="612.87">it's a good thing to try and get those</span> <span data-start="612.87" data-end="615">down and ideally removed if at all</span> <span data-start="615" data-end="616.44">possible and the way to do that normally</span> <span data-start="616.44" data-end="619.26">is to reserve space for your content</span> <span data-start="619.26" data-end="620.73">ahead of time in your style so that</span> <span data-start="620.73" data-end="622.08">you're not just leaving content to just</span> <span data-start="622.08" data-end="623.91">move other content of the way if</span> <span data-start="623.91" data-end="625.29">sometimes it's not possible but where</span> <span data-start="625.29" data-end="627.63">you can if you can mark certain areas as</span> <span data-start="627.63" data-end="629.55">being the correct size ahead of time</span> <span data-start="629.55" data-end="630.69">that should help</span> <span data-start="630.69" data-end="632.61">an awful lot so that's that's the layout</span> <span data-start="632.61" data-end="637.11">shift information so that's added in so</span> <span data-start="637.11" data-end="638.55">those are the main bits of performance</span> <span data-start="638.55" data-end="641.37">in summary we had the timings which are</span> <span data-start="641.37" data-end="643.71">here I've got the layout shifts and we</span> <span data-start="643.71" data-end="645.6">also had long-running tests which we</span> <span data-start="645.6" data-end="647.07">show
