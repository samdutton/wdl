<p><span data-start="38.39" data-end="40.85">One of the big shifts we've seen is around retail and</span> <span data-start="40.85" data-end="43.89">commerce.

<p><span data-start="77.14" data-end="79.31">My omelets are certainly looking a lot better.</span> <span data-start="79.68" data-end="81.77">And then there's the story of Foodleh.</span> <span data-start="81.77" data-end="85.1">A couple of university students quickly built a site</span> <span data-start="85.14" data-end="88.23">to allow people to order directly from the local street</span> <span data-start="88.23" data-end="91.03">hawkers in Singapore, bridging the online-offline</span> <span data-start="91.61" data-end="94.28">gap.

<p><span data-start="109.92" data-end="112.63">And speaking of being impressed, we're really fortunate to</span> <span data-start="112.63" data-end="115.72">have a really healthy framework ecosystem on the web where</span> <span data-start="115.72" data-end="118.14">different approaches can be explored in different ways.</span> <span data-start="118.89" data-end="121.39">Now, Vue is a popular and well-loved framework with</span> <span data-start="121.68" data-end="124.02">particularly large usage in the APAC region.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="124.6" data-end="127.35">So we wanted to invite Evan You, the creator of Vue, for a</span> <span data-start="127.35" data-end="128.35">chat.</span> <span data-start="129.27" data-end="130.11">Hi Dion, nice to be here.</span> <span data-start="130.11" data-end="131.86">Hey, Evan, thanks so much for joining us.</span> <span data-start="132.36" data-end="134.65">Now, I'd kinda love to start at the beginning of the</span> <span data-start="134.78" data-end="137.24">history of Vue and the story as you've gone through</span> <span data-start="137.66" data-end="140.07">different evolutions from version 1 to 2, and now</span> <span data-start="140.74" data-end="142.12">what you're working on with version 3.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="142.62" data-end="145.5">Sure. Vue started out as a personal</span> <span data-start="145.54" data-end="148.17">experimental project back in 2013</span> <span data-start="148.62" data-end="152.04">and was first made public in February 2014.</span> <span data-start="152.63" data-end="155.17">The initial goal was really just to create something</span> <span data-start="155.67" data-end="157.51">that I would enjoy using myself.</span> <span data-start="157.59" data-end="159.84">It was a very small library combining the data</span> <span data-start="160.8" data-end="163.89">binding that was inspired by Angular 1 with</span> <span data-start="163.93" data-end="166.89">a ES5 getter/setter based reactivity</span> <span data-start="166.89" data-end="167.89">system.</span> <span data-start="168.85" data-end="171.69">Because we used getter/setters, it was not a IE8</span> <span data-start="172.15" data-end="174.82">compatible when it came out, which a lot of people took</span> <span data-start="174.82" data-end="177.78">issues with, but I'm kinda glad we made that decision</span> <span data-start="178.07" data-end="179.07">in the early days.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="179.7" data-end="183.03">Later on we released version 2 and started</span> <span data-start="183.12" data-end="185.91">adding more and more supporting</span> <span data-start="186.16" data-end="187.45">libraries to it.</span> <span data-start="187.5" data-end="191">So, for example, we added a router, we added a CLI.</span> <span data-start="192.08" data-end="195.34">So as we added more parts, it started to become more like</span> <span data-start="195.42" data-end="196.42">a framework.</span> <span data-start="197.88" data-end="199.17">But we still kinda loosely</span> <span data-start="200.97" data-end="204.26">followed the concept that it should be incrementally</span> <span data-start="204.26" data-end="207.6">adoptable so it's not as</span> <span data-start="208.43" data-end="211.06">monolithic as some other solutions,</span> <span data-start="211.85" data-end="213.65">but also it's no longer just a single</span> <span data-start="214.94" data-end="216.65">library that does only one thing.</span> <span data-start="218.36" data-end="221.41">The major change in version 2 was the introduction of</span> <span data-start="221.49" data-end="224.03">the virtual DOM as the underlying rendering layer which</span> <span data-start="224.91" data-end="227.49">opened up a few interesting capabilities at the time.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="227.62" data-end="230.91">For example, server-side rendering or rendering to</span> <span data-start="231.25" data-end="232.63">other platforms.</span> <span data-start="233.25" data-end="236.13">Right now we are hard at work in finishing up version 3,</span> <span data-start="236.71" data-end="239.72">which is a major rewrite and it brings up</span> <span data-start="239.72" data-end="242.72">a lot of new interesting features and</span> <span data-start="242.72" data-end="243.72">changes.</span> <span data-start="244.01" data-end="246.56">There are so many things, so I'll just mention a few</span> <span data-start="247.14" data-end="248.14">highlights here.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="248.39" data-end="251.44">We added the composition API, which exposes the</span> <span data-start="251.44" data-end="254.1">lower level reactivity API's inside view</span> <span data-start="254.94" data-end="257.61">for advanced larger composition and reduce</span> <span data-start="258.11" data-end="259.15">large applications.</span> <span data-start="259.61" data-end="262.4">We rewrote the reactivity system using ES2015</span> <span data-start="262.82" data-end="266.16">proxies, which greatly improved performance.</span> <span data-start="267.24" data-end="270.04">The rendering layer rewrite is also seeing</span> <span data-start="270.25" data-end="272.37">great performance improvements.</span> <span data-start="273.04" data-end="276.09">The bundler, the library</span> <span data-start="276.09" data-end="278.88">itself is now fully tree-shaking compatible, so you will</span> <span data-start="278.96" data-end="280.38">see smaller bundles.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="281.05" data-end="284.09">We added first class TypeScript support, more modular</span> <span data-start="284.09" data-end="286.8">internal architecture for better maintenance</span> <span data-start="287.22" data-end="288.22">and tooling integration.</span> <span data-start="288.68" data-end="291.39">So there is a lot more we are</span> <span data-start="291.68" data-end="292.69">shipping in Vue 3.</span> <span data-start="292.94" data-end="295.98">We are still hard at work, ironing out some</span> <span data-start="295.98" data-end="298.57">of the rough edges, but it's going to be ready very soon.</span> <span data-start="299.19" data-end="299.69">102 01:05:17,083  — > 01:05:19,333
quite a while with 2013 being the birth of Vue</span> <span data-start="305.11" data-end="307.78">and obviously you worked on the Web before then.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="308.16" data-end="311.29">I'm curious, as you've seen the evolutions and</span> <span data-start="311.29" data-end="314.62">seen what's going on right now, how do you feel about</span> <span data-start="314.75" data-end="316.92">Web development in 2020?</span> <span data-start="318.04" data-end="319.63">What are the most pressing issues?</span> <span data-start="319.67" data-end="321.09">What are you focusing on?</span> <span data-start="321.26" data-end="323.13">What are the problems that you see that Web developers</span> <span data-start="323.13" data-end="326.09">have, and how do you feel you and Vue can help there?</span> <span data-start="326.93" data-end="327.93">Sure.</span> <span data-start="328.26" data-end="330.72">I think the ecosystem right now is at a transition</span> <span data-start="331.6" data-end="333.31">period where we are seeing a lot of</span> <span data-start="334.64" data-end="338.11">these new language standards features,</span> <span data-start="338.15" data-end="340.48">new platform capabilities are</span> <span data-start="341.65" data-end="344.9">finally stable and consistent and shipped</span> <span data-start="344.95" data-end="346.95">in all these evergreen browsers.</span> <span data-start="346.99" data-end="350.33">So all these mainstream browsers</span> <span data-start="350.58" data-end="353.5">in their latest version now have very consistent support</span> <span data-start="353.5" data-end="354.87">for these latest features.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="356.12" data-end="358.13">And IE11 is finally on the way of phasing</span> <span data-start="359.38" data-end="361.17">out. So that presents an opportunity</span> <span data-start="362.88" data-end="365.22">for new stacks or new</span> <span data-start="367.34" data-end="370.01">tooling to break free of the shackles of these legacy</span> <span data-start="370.01" data-end="372.35">problems and rethink how we can</span> <span data-start="373.02" data-end="375.48">best take advantage of these new features that we</span> <span data-start="376.35" data-end="379.65">can finally use for the large majority</span> <span data-start="379.65" data-end="382.82">of our users. So I think,</span> <span data-start="383.07" data-end="384.07">for example, most</span> <span data-start="386.11" data-end="388.53">of these major browsers now support native ES module</span> <span data-start="388.53" data-end="391.62">imports, which present some interesting</span> <span data-start="393.41" data-end="396.21">technical possibilities that we can leverage to</span> <span data-start="396.66" data-end="399.63">build something — to rethink</span> <span data-start="399.67" data-end="400.96">our development workflow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="401.46" data-end="404.05">Got it. Yeah, I've actually been watching you in your</span> <span data-start="404.21" data-end="406.97">Twitter feed explore some of these things.</span> <span data-start="407.67" data-end="410.09">I've seen you working on Vite and VitePress.</span> <span data-start="411.09" data-end="413.51">I was wondering if you could explain a little bit more on</span> <span data-start="415.14" data-end="416.02">what these are doing.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="416.02" data-end="417.02">Sure.</span> <span data-start="418.44" data-end="419.44">Vite is</span> <span data-start="421.86" data-end="424.9">a web development build tool that combines a dev</span> <span data-start="425.03" data-end="426.44">server with a build step.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="427.19" data-end="429.57">Now, the interesting part is in the dev server, we are</span> <span data-start="429.57" data-end="432.91">leveraging the browsers native ES module import</span> <span data-start="432.91" data-end="436.5">handling to provide a bundle free development experience.</span> <span data-start="436.83" data-end="439.71">So instead of bundling your whole app, Vite</span> <span data-start="440.04" data-end="442.92">lets the browser import your modules as needed,</span> <span data-start="443.92" data-end="447.38">using native imports and only processing them on-demand</span> <span data-start="447.59" data-end="449.22">when the browser actually requests them.</span> <span data-start="449.63" data-end="452.8">So this has a few advantages over the traditional</span> <span data-start="452.8" data-end="454.47">bundling-based dev servers.</span> <span data-start="455.06" data-end="456.64">The first thing is when you have</span> <span data-start="458.02" data-end="461.02">a large app you may have a lot of modules</span> <span data-start="461.1" data-end="463.23">in your application but when you are working</span> <span data-start="464.15" data-end="467.36">on a specific part of your application, maybe</span> <span data-start="467.36" data-end="470.11">you only need to import a subset of these modules.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="470.45" data-end="472.91">So on-demand import compilation</span> <span data-start="473.53" data-end="476.33">using Vite's approach allows you to only compile</span> <span data-start="476.58" data-end="479.58">the necessary modules for the part that you're</span> <span data-start="479.62" data-end="482.62">actually working on. So this results in a much faster</span> <span data-start="483.5" data-end="485.84">server startup time in large applications.</span> <span data-start="486.13" data-end="488.46">The second part is Vite also supports Hot Module</span> <span data-start="489.13" data-end="491.76">Replacement on top of native ES module imports.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="492.13" data-end="495.22">Now, with native use module imports,</span> <span data-start="495.47" data-end="498.14">because we don't have to do the whole bundling scope</span> <span data-start="498.39" data-end="500.77">crawling when handling Hot Module Replacement,</span> <span data-start="502.23" data-end="504.61">the implementation is actually much simpler and much more</span> <span data-start="504.65" data-end="505.65">efficient.</span> <span data-start="506.4" data-end="508.48">So it will stay blazing fast even</span> <span data-start="509.94" data-end="513.07">as your app grows which keeps the</span> <span data-start="513.24" data-end="515.57">development feedback loop fast no matter how big</span> <span data-start="516.28" data-end="517.28">your app is.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="518.12" data-end="520.83">So I believe this really presents an</span> <span data-start="522.41" data-end="525">interesting option because the development experience is so</span> <span data-start="525" data-end="528">close to the old days where we first got into</span> <span data-start="528" data-end="530.51">web development, where you just have an index.html</span> <span data-start="531.34" data-end="534.18">page and you import some scripts to</span> <span data-start="534.68" data-end="537.43">get things going. Vite tries to</span> <span data-start="538.26" data-end="541.18">simplify the whole development setup</span> <span data-start="543.02" data-end="545.6">and present a development experience as close to</span> <span data-start="546.06" data-end="548.48">the original vanilla web development experience as</span> <span data-start="548.65" data-end="551.23">possible, but without giving up all the modern</span> <span data-start="552.03" data-end="554.4">new tooling capabilities that we are used to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.53" data-end="556.57">So it's still</span> <span data-start="557.66" data-end="560.29">kind of experimental at this stage, but we're getting</span> <span data-start="560.87" data-end="563.12">a lot of good feedback from users already.</span> <span data-start="563.54" data-end="565.33">Got it. That's really exciting.</span> <span data-start="565.37" data-end="567.58">I love this new trend towards</span> <span data-start="568.67" data-end="571.25">dev time not having to deal with bundling</span> <span data-start="571.88" data-end="574.22">and the like and production. We can still obviously do a</span> <span data-start="574.22" data-end="576.97">lot of that, push out all of the optimizations we can.</span> <span data-start="577.3" data-end="579.39">Obviously, everything we can do to help users makes sense.</span> <span data-start="580.68" data-end="581.93">So that's Vite. What about VitePress?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="582.64" data-end="584.06">Well, how does that tie into this?</span> <span data-start="584.18" data-end="585.35">Oh yeah.</span> <span data-start="586.4" data-end="588.86">If you don't know VitePress, VitePress is a remake</span> <span data-start="589.61" data-end="592.61">of VuePress and VuePress is a static side</span> <span data-start="592.61" data-end="595.65">generator built on top of Vue, which allows</span> <span data-start="595.65" data-end="599.07">you to write markdown, use Vue components</span> <span data-start="599.07" data-end="602.29">in your markdown, and write custom themes using</span> <span data-start="602.29" data-end="604.2">Vue as a Vue application.</span> <span data-start="604.71" data-end="607.25">Now VuePress was based on webpack,</span> <span data-start="608.29" data-end="611.42">so VitePress is essentially a remake of VuePress, but using</span> <span data-start="611.42" data-end="612.84">Vite as the underlying</span> <span data-start="614.38" data-end="615.38">build tool.</span> <span data-start="619.68" data-end="622.39">So first of all, that provides obviously a much faster</span> <span data-start="623.35" data-end="626.56">development experience, a faster server startup, and faster</span> <span data-start="626.94" data-end="628.27">updates when you edit a page.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="628.9" data-end="631.98">Another aspect of it is we are baking a lot of</span> <span data-start="632.36" data-end="634.36">performance best practices into VitePress.</span> <span data-start="639.66" data-end="642.24">We see a lot of static side generators based on</span> <span data-start="642.66" data-end="644.33">universal JavaScript frameworks.</span> <span data-start="645" data-end="648.04">For example, we have Next.js, which is</span> <span data-start="648.83" data-end="651.67">nuxt.js for Vue, which are both excellent projects, but</span> <span data-start="651.96" data-end="655.01">when we are using services to</span> <span data-start="655.01" data-end="658.18">send static content to the client we often face</span> <span data-start="658.18" data-end="661.18">the problem of the double payload issue, where</span> <span data-start="661.43" data-end="663.97">you're sending the static content as HTML, but you're also</span> <span data-start="663.97" data-end="666.73">sending a lot of JavaScript which was used to render the</span> <span data-start="666.89" data-end="669.6">same content, which is</span> <span data-start="669.94" data-end="671.44">useless when it's on a client.</span> <span data-start="671.56" data-end="674.44">And then we're spending time on the client to hydrate those</span> <span data-start="674.44" data-end="676.15">content using JavaScript.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="676.61" data-end="678.95">So there's a lot of room for improvement here and VuePress</span> <span data-start="680.49" data-end="681.49">tries to tackle that.</span> <span data-start="682.07" data-end="685.12">It takes advantage of Vue 3's compiler to</span> <span data-start="685.12" data-end="687.04">do static analysis and we automatically</span> <span data-start="688.21" data-end="690.87">detect all the static parts that won't change</span> <span data-start="691.58" data-end="692.67">in your page.</span> <span data-start="693.42" data-end="696.34">Then we concatenate them — stringify</span> <span data-start="696.42" data-end="698.84">them — into static strings and eventually</span> <span data-start="699.42" data-end="702.09">safely remove them during the production build.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="702.43" data-end="705.72">So that decouples the current page JavaScript</span> <span data-start="705.72" data-end="708.93">payload of your page from the content.</span> <span data-start="709.48" data-end="711.31">So you're only paying for the dynamic</span> <span data-start="712.77" data-end="715.82">bits inside your page and all the static</span> <span data-start="715.82" data-end="717.28">content will have no impact on</span> <span data-start="718.82" data-end="721.36">the JavaScript payload size and have no impact on the</span> <span data-start="721.74" data-end="723.53">client side hydration performance.</span> <span data-start="724.83" data-end="728.04">So I think that's a pretty significant improvement</span> <span data-start="728.04" data-end="731.12">to how VuePress was handling things.</span> <span data-start="734.33" data-end="737.46">When we finish it, we're excited to see how much of</span> <span data-start="737.46" data-end="740.59">a performance improvement this can bring to our users</span> <span data-start="740.59" data-end="741.59">across the board.</span> <span data-start="741.93" data-end="744.51">Got it.

<p><span data-start="792.56" data-end="796.19">So when we first worked on the documentation,</span> <span data-start="796.48" data-end="799.11">because I am a native Chinese speaker and I know a lot of</span> <span data-start="799.11" data-end="801.44">Chinese developers sort of struggle when</span> <span data-start="802.53" data-end="805.61">they see really dense technical text written in English.</span> <span data-start="806.45" data-end="808.83">It's not that they cannot attempt to read it.</span> <span data-start="808.95" data-end="812.08">It's just when you are reading something</span> <span data-start="812.08" data-end="815.62">that's not in your native tongue, it takes so much longer.</span> <span data-start="816.33" data-end="818.5">It makes it so much less efficient to learn.</span> <span data-start="818.79" data-end="821.67">It takes much longer to get the click when you're learning</span> <span data-start="821.67" data-end="823.8">something new with the language that you're</span> <span data-start="824.67" data-end="825.68">not used to.

<p><span data-start="841.44" data-end="844.49">They started taking over the maintenance of the Chinese</span> <span data-start="844.49" data-end="847.36">docs and we're seeing a lot of contributions</span> <span data-start="847.45" data-end="850.08">to translate Vue docs into other languages as well.</span> <span data-start="850.45" data-end="852.7">So I think this good</span> <span data-start="853.58" data-end="855.75">internationalization, localization effort is</span> <span data-start="856.67" data-end="859.54">definitely critical in helping Vue's</span> <span data-start="859.75" data-end="861.29">adoption in these areas.</span> </p>

So we have all spent a good amount of</span> <span data-start="1021.96" data-end="1024.37">time configuring our bundles and our</span> <span data-start="1025.13" data-end="1026.75">approach to bundling strategies.</span> <span data-start="1027.46" data-end="1030.09">But ultimately, there is a lack of transparency when it</span> <span data-start="1030.09" data-end="1032.42">comes to the JavaScript getting all bundled up and shipped</span> <span data-start="1032.42" data-end="1033.43">into production.</span> <span data-start="1034.05" data-end="1036.89">They're just these big files and it's easy for us to treat</span> <span data-start="1037.22" data-end="1038.51">them as black boxes.</span> <span data-start="1038.76" data-end="1040.81">And some of us on the Lighthouse team have worked on</span> <span data-start="1040.81" data-end="1043.1">community tools like Source Map Explorer,</span> </p>

<p><span data-start="1081.97" data-end="1084.81">This is great, and it's actually just like what you see in</span> <span data-start="1084.93" data-end="1086.69">the coverage panel in Chrome DevTools.</span> <span data-start="1088.1" data-end="1090.82">But we can improve this. If we know a little bit more about</span> <span data-start="1090.94" data-end="1093.86">the actual JavaScript bundles, we can actually explore them</span> <span data-start="1093.94" data-end="1096.99">and see OK for each bundle file, what are all of the</span> <span data-start="1097.07" data-end="1099.28">original modules that were on disk source</span> <span data-start="1100.28" data-end="1103.54">files and understand how much of them</span> <span data-start="1103.62" data-end="1104.91">were unused and used?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1105.25" data-end="1108.54">And this really helps us understand a bit more</span> <span data-start="1108.54" data-end="1111.71">about the kind of code that is not actually being</span> <span data-start="1111.71" data-end="1112.71">run.</span> <span data-start="1113.92" data-end="1116.88">Another new audit that we're introducing is one that</span> <span data-start="1117.18" data-end="1119.43">identifies duplicate modules across JavaScript</span> <span data-start="1120.3" data-end="1122.72">bundles.

<p><span data-start="1247.26" data-end="1249.1">So, again, it's early.</span> <span data-start="1249.35" data-end="1251.02">This will all change quite a bit.</span> <span data-start="1251.1" data-end="1253.98">But we're really excited about bringing this experience to</span> <span data-start="1254.1" data-end="1255.1">you.</span> <span data-start="1255.48" data-end="1258.44">It's all coming soon to a Lighthouse near you.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1259.53" data-end="1262.49">Got it. I'm always — I always love kind of opening</span> <span data-start="1262.53" data-end="1265.74">up some of the old bundles and seeing all of the mistakes</span> <span data-start="1265.74" data-end="1267.91">I've made in the past. I'm excited to play around with</span> <span data-start="1267.91" data-end="1271.16">this. Now, a few weeks ago, we also shipped</span> <span data-start="1271.7" data-end="1274.79">Lighthouse 6.0 and I bet that's the version where we</span> <span data-start="1274.79" data-end="1277.34">now started to include Core Web Vitals.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1277.38" data-end="1277.79">Is that right?</span> <span data-start="1277.79" data-end="1280.38">Yeah, that's right. All right. So Core Web Vitals, we got</span> <span data-start="1280.38" data-end="1281.76">these three metrics, Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay,</span> <span data-start="1283.55" data-end="1286.34">and Cumulative Layout Shift, though it's worth pointing out</span> <span data-start="1286.43" data-end="1288.18">that FID, First Input Delay, is</span> <span data-start="1289.89" data-end="1291.35">a field metric.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1292.1" data-end="1295.1">And since Lighthouse is a lab tool, in</span> <span data-start="1295.1" data-end="1297.23">its place we have another metric TBT, total</span> <span data-start="1298.11" data-end="1301.4">blocking time. We like to think of this as FIDs</span> <span data-start="1301.61" data-end="1302.82">lab companion.</span> <span data-start="1303.65" data-end="1305.82">So they're not measuring exactly the same thing, but</span> <span data-start="1305.86" data-end="1308.53">they're all about interactivity, they're all about long</span> <span data-start="1309.16" data-end="1311.95">tasks on the main thread, and heavily influenced by them.</span> <span data-start="1312.33" data-end="1314.12">So it really works well.</span> <span data-start="1314.33" data-end="1316.46">So in Lighthouse 6.0, you'll see these three metrics up</span> <span data-start="1316.46" data-end="1317.46">top.</span> <span data-start="1318.33" data-end="1321">And if you're looking at it and your report looks like this</span> <span data-start="1321" data-end="1324.22">one, then you're like, wow, OK, well, these metrics</span> <span data-start="1324.22" data-end="1326.18">are — they're not great.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1326.22" data-end="1328.09">Looks like I can make some improvements here.</span> <span data-start="1328.34" data-end="1329.72">All right. But what's the next step?</span> <span data-start="1330.14" data-end="1333.31">We've added some new audits to</span> <span data-start="1333.31" data-end="1334.93">help point you in the right direction.</span> <span data-start="1335.6" data-end="1337.73">So I'll go right through them right now.</span> <span data-start="1338.35" data-end="1340.06">First one I'll show is this,</span> <span data-start="1342.23" data-end="1343.23">Avoid long main thread tasks.</span> <span data-start="1343.61" data-end="1346.65">So here we're just listing the longest tasks</span> <span data-start="1346.86" data-end="1349.07">on the main thread that you have, how long they took, and</span> <span data-start="1349.82" data-end="1352.12">what URL we can attribute them to.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1353.91" data-end="1356.29">And then two more. We have the largest contentful paint</span> <span data-start="1356.29" data-end="1358.08">element. The metric itself is telling</span> <span data-start="1359.25" data-end="1362.04">you at what time that paint happened, but that paint was</span> <span data-start="1362.04" data-end="1364.96">associated with a particular DOM element, and here, this</span> <span data-start="1364.96" data-end="1367.97">will just tell you. And similarly for cumulative layout</span> <span data-start="1367.97" data-end="1370.6">shift, you want to know what the actual shifts were?</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1370.68" data-end="1373.06">Well, these were the DOM elements that shifted.</span> <span data-start="1373.89" data-end="1376.81">And these ones contributed most to your total</span> <span data-start="1376.89" data-end="1377.94">CLS value.</span> <span data-start="1379.27" data-end="1382.19">So you could just read this,</span> <span data-start="1382.77" data-end="1384.69">and so you'll see this content container.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1385.03" data-end="1387.53">OK, yeah, I know what that is. But then if you're looking</span> <span data-start="1387.53" data-end="1389.99">at these other two items and you're like, OK, but</span> <span data-start="1390.45" data-end="1392.03">which actual DOM element is this?</span> <span data-start="1392.66" data-end="1395.95">If you run Lighthouse through DevTools, we actually have</span> <span data-start="1396.12" data-end="1398.54">a nice little surprise for you. So there, we kind</span> <span data-start="1399.17" data-end="1401.33">of upgrade these element references.</span> <span data-start="1401.42" data-end="1403.96">So if you hover over them, we'll actually just</span> <span data-start="1405.25" data-end="1408.34">apply that element inspection hover tooltip</span> <span data-start="1408.55" data-end="1409.55">that you normally get in DevTools.</span> <span data-start="1410.18" data-end="1412.22">And if you click through, you'll see it in the DOM tree</span> <span data-start="1412.22" data-end="1413.55">elements panel.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1413.76" data-end="1415.56">So that's kind of integration to help you understand</span> <span data-start="1415.56" data-end="1417.06">exactly what thing you're looking at.</span> <span data-start="1418.43" data-end="1421.31">This is just a small slice of the new stuff in 6.0, please</span> <span data-start="1424.02" data-end="1426.73">check out our blog posts for all the rest of the fun stuff.</span> <span data-start="1427.74" data-end="1429.57">Got it. I'm always a sucker for these audits.</span> <span data-start="1429.61" data-end="1431.95">It's great to be able to kind of just go from the metrics</span> <span data-start="1431.95" data-end="1435.08">themselves in the scores and really go deeper to understand</span> <span data-start="1435.08" data-end="1437.2">what's affecting them. Thanks so much, Paul.</span> <span data-start="1437.95" data-end="1440.5">I love how we're making sure to open up as much data</span> <span data-start="1440.92" data-end="1443.21">as we can with the Chrome User Experience Report.</span> <span data-start="1443.84" data-end="1446.42">And I keep seeing great mashups and analysis from the</span> <span data-start="1446.42" data-end="1449.47">community, such as the Onely Map, which lets you</span> <span data-start="1449.47" data-end="1452.18">kind of zoom around the world and kind of explore the</span> <span data-start="1452.43" data-end="1455.18">performance characteristics for a different device types</span> <span data-start="1455.43" data-end="1456.81">and obviously different locations.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1457.14" data-end="1459.85">Now, Lighthouse is a great tool to help you audit your web</span> <span data-start="1459.85" data-end="1462.98">apps, and it helps you not only with just performance</span> <span data-start="1462.98" data-end="1464.98">of course, but really across the board.</span> <span data-start="1465.65" data-end="1468.36">And we want you to be free to create the highest quality</span> <span data-start="1468.36" data-end="1471.2">web apps that give you the biggest reach to users across</span> <span data-start="1471.28" data-end="1472.61">whatever device they're using.</span> <span data-start="1472.74" data-end="1475.41">Now to hear more about the latest in PWAs and advanced</span> <span data-start="1475.87" data-end="1477.66">capabilities, let's welcome Pete LePage.</span> <span data-start="1478.49" data-end="1479.91">Awesome. Thanks, Dion.</span> <span data-start="1480.37" data-end="1483.58">We believe that you should be able to build and deliver</span> <span data-start="1483.75" data-end="1485.29">any kind of app on the Web.</span> <span data-start="1485.96" data-end="1488.46">Web apps should be able to deliver the same kinds of</span> <span data-start="1488.46" data-end="1490.51">experiences with the same capabilities as</span> <span data-start="1491.59" data-end="1492.59">native apps.</span> <span data-start="1493.09" data-end="1495.97">Combining the installability and reliability of progressive</span> <span data-start="1496.18" data-end="1499.18">web apps with our capabilities project, we're</span> <span data-start="1499.18" data-end="1502.14">working to close the gap, and help you build</span> <span data-start="1502.23" data-end="1503.77">and deliver great experiences.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1505.48" data-end="1507.19">To do that, we've been focusing on three things.</span> <span data-start="1507.61" data-end="1509.86">First, we've been working hard to give you and</span> <span data-start="1510.78" data-end="1514.28">users more control over the install experience,</span> <span data-start="1514.57" data-end="1518.03">removing the mini infobar, adding an install promotion</span> <span data-start="1518.03" data-end="1519.54">to the omnibox, and more.</span> <span data-start="1520.54" data-end="1523.37">But one of my favorite things about the Web is how</span> <span data-start="1523.37" data-end="1525">ubiquitous it is.</span> <span data-start="1525.5" data-end="1528.21">We know that for some businesses, it's really important</span> <span data-start="1528.79" data-end="1530.71">to have your app in the store.</span> <span data-start="1531.59" data-end="1534.51">At Chrome Dev Summit we previewed a library and CLI</span> <span data-start="1535.01" data-end="1537.09">called Bubble Wrap, then called Llama-Pack.</span> <span data-start="1538.1" data-end="1541.14">It makes it trivial to get your PWA into the</span> <span data-start="1541.14" data-end="1543.06">Play Store. In fact PWAbuilder.com</span> <span data-start="1544.48" data-end="1546.69">now uses Bubble Wrap under the hood.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1547.06" data-end="1548.31">In just a few mouse clicks.</span> <span data-start="1548.44" data-end="1550.94">I can generate an APK that I can upload to the Play</span> <span data-start="1551.48" data-end="1554.86">Store. Second, we're providing tighter</span> <span data-start="1554.9" data-end="1556.28">integration with the operating system.</span> <span data-start="1556.28" data-end="1559.28">Like the ability to share a photo, song, or</span> <span data-start="1559.28" data-end="1561.62">whatever else by invoking the system-level</span> <span data-start="1562.24" data-end="1563.25">share service.</span> <span data-start="1563.5" data-end="1566.46">Or the other way around — being able to receive content</span> <span data-start="1567.08" data-end="1568.92">when shared from other installed apps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1568.92" data-end="1570.84">You can keep users up to date or subtly</span> <span data-start="1572.46" data-end="1574.63">notify them of new activity with app badging.</span> <span data-start="1575.34" data-end="1578.22">And make it easy for users</span> <span data-start="1578.43" data-end="1580.97">to quickly start an action using app shortcuts which</span> <span data-start="1581.51" data-end="1582.52">will land in Chrome 84.</span> <span data-start="1583.56" data-end="1586.73">And finally, we're working to enable new capabilities</span> <span data-start="1586.98" data-end="1589.86">that enable new scenarios that weren't possible before.</span> <span data-start="1590.23" data-end="1593.44">Like editors that read and write files on the user's</span> <span data-start="1593.44" data-end="1596.61">local file system, or getting a list of locally</span> <span data-start="1596.61" data-end="1599.7">installed fonts so that users can use them in their design.</span> <span data-start="1600.12" data-end="1601.45">Of course, there's plenty more.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1601.58" data-end="1604.62">So stay tuned. But I hear, Dion, you've been</span> <span data-start="1604.62" data-end="1606.29">playing with the TikTok PWA.</span> <span data-start="1606.62" data-end="1609.33">That's right. That is my 10-year-old son, Josh, who started</span> <span data-start="1609.33" data-end="1611.92">to create some really fun TikTok content, even though</span> <span data-start="1612.38" data-end="1614.92">he was pretty restricted these days to the house and</span> <span data-start="1615.38" data-end="1616.38">the pets and the like.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1617.17" data-end="1620.39">And he kept bugging me to join in and play</span> <span data-start="1620.39" data-end="1621.39">myself.</span> <span data-start="1622.35" data-end="1625.27">And yeah, I was a little bit gun shy,</span> <span data-start="1625.31" data-end="1627.81">so to speak, on that side. But it actually gave me a great</span> <span data-start="1627.81" data-end="1630.6">excuse to play with a really well built PWA</span> <span data-start="1630.9" data-end="1633.32">that the TikTok Web team put together that I didn't even</span> <span data-start="1633.32" data-end="1636.4">know about. It Is really, really a nice, rich</span> <span data-start="1636.82" data-end="1637.78">experience there.</span> <span data-start="1637.78" data-end="1638.65">That's really cool.</span> <span data-start="1638.65" data-end="1640.53">And all of these things that we've been working on — things</span> <span data-start="1640.95" data-end="1644.08">like the app shortcuts — are gonna be a great</span> <span data-start="1644.08" data-end="1647.33">addition to them. The idea that you can push and hold</span> <span data-start="1647.33" data-end="1650.33">on the app icon and be able to quickly jump in and</span> <span data-start="1650.33" data-end="1651.33">create a new TikTok.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1651.96" data-end="1654.42">Or push and hold and say, hey, I want to see my friends</span> <span data-start="1654.67" data-end="1657.26">TikToks. Or the ability to be able to show app badges</span> <span data-start="1657.97" data-end="1660.38">when a friend has posted something new or something like</span> <span data-start="1660.38" data-end="1663.1">that. So there's plenty of great stuff coming that they</span> <span data-start="1663.39" data-end="1665.22">can take advantage of. And so can you.</span> <span data-start="1665.77" data-end="1666.97">That's excellent.
