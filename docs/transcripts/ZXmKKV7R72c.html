<p><span data-start="10.2" data-end="10.99">Hi, everyone.</span> <span data-start="10.99" data-end="12.41">This is Eiji. Today.</span> <span data-start="12.49" data-end="14.2">I'm going to talk about Web Payments.</span> <span data-start="15.75" data-end="18.16">Web Payments is the name of the W3C Working Group and a set</span> <span data-start="18.21" data-end="20.83">of standard APIs that brings dedicated payment</span> <span data-start="20.83" data-end="23.46">functionalities to the browsers for the first time in the</span> <span data-start="23.46" data-end="24.67">history of the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="26.09" data-end="29.13">There are several specifications under Web Payments, but</span> <span data-start="29.13" data-end="32.51">the two most important ones are Payment Request API</span> <span data-start="33.26" data-end="34.56">and Payment Handler API.</span> <span data-start="36.31" data-end="38.98">The Payment Request API provides a standardized way to</span> <span data-start="39.23" data-end="42.15">invoke a browser-mediated low friction payment flow</span> <span data-start="42.19" data-end="44.65">on the web, similar to what users might already be</span> <span data-start="45.15" data-end="47.19">familiar with in many native apps.</span> <span data-start="48.36" data-end="51.45">The Payment Handler API allows payment apps to plug</span> <span data-start="51.45" data-end="53.91">into the Payment Request API to enable form-free</span> <span data-start="54.53" data-end="55.54">payments on the Web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="56.41" data-end="58.58">Here's how a web payment flow starts.</span> <span data-start="59.46" data-end="61.46">A website invokes a Payment Request API.</span> <span data-start="62.29" data-end="64.88">Customer's preferred payment app is launched inside a</span> <span data-start="65" data-end="66.05">special modal window.</span> <span data-start="66.92" data-end="70.01">The customer interacts with a payment app to confirm and</span> <span data-start="70.01" data-end="71.22">authorize the transaction.</span> <span data-start="71.59" data-end="74.22">The payment app returns a payment credential that can be</span> <span data-start="74.22" data-end="75.43">verified and processed.</span> <span data-start="76.14" data-end="78.52">There has been some confusion between Web Payments APIs,</span> <span data-start="79.27" data-end="82.15">and wallet-specific JavaScript APIs.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="82.9" data-end="85.32">To clarify, Web Payments APIs are low-level web platform</span> <span data-start="85.73" data-end="89.07">primitives that are W3C standard proposals.</span> <span data-start="90.36" data-end="92.41">Digital wallets such as Google Pay provide</span> <span data-start="93.36" data-end="96.41">JavaScript APIs that can be built on top of</span> <span data-start="96.41" data-end="97.41">the Web Payments APIs.</span> <span data-start="98.41" data-end="101.41">Support for Web Payments APIs across browsers is</span> <span data-start="101.41" data-end="103.79">progressing slowly but steadily.</span> <span data-start="105.04" data-end="108.55">Today, outside of Chrome, limited support is available</span> <span data-start="108.71" data-end="111.67">in Safari, Samsung Internet, Edge,</span> <span data-start="112.05" data-end="113.05">Opera, and Brave.</span> <span data-start="114.47" data-end="117.47">Mozilla is working on adding support to Firefox</span> <span data-start="117.64" data-end="118.64">as well.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="118.93" data-end="122.27">There are two ways an existing payment app can integrate</span> <span data-start="122.31" data-end="123.56">with Payment Request API.</span> <span data-start="124.27" data-end="127.23">The best option for a payment app with an existing</span> <span data-start="127.23" data-end="130.28">web-based flow is to implement the Payment Handler</span> <span data-start="130.32" data-end="132.24">API by adding a service worker to their</span> <span data-start="133.28" data-end="134.82">existing payment experience.</span> <span data-start="136.37" data-end="139.2">A payment app that is primarily a native app</span> <span data-start="139.49" data-end="142.37">can integrate with Chrome on Android using the Pay</span> <span data-start="142.46" data-end="143.41">intent.</span> <span data-start="143.87" data-end="146.42">It's been a few years since Web Payments was announced.</span> <span data-start="147.67" data-end="150.38">Some of you might be curious what's been going on in the</span> <span data-start="150.38" data-end="151.38">meantime.</span> <span data-start="152.13" data-end="155.09">The short answer is that we've been actively working on it.</span> <span data-start="156.09" data-end="159.22">Recently, our focus has moved from trying to figure out</span> <span data-start="159.43" data-end="162.48">how Payment Request API can be directly valuable to</span> <span data-start="162.48" data-end="165.77">merchants, to how the APIs can enable</span> <span data-start="165.94" data-end="167.98">better payment app experiences on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="169.11" data-end="170.53">Let me tell you a bit more about it.</span> <span data-start="171.36" data-end="174.03">We started by focusing on making the Payment Request API</span> <span data-start="174.49" data-end="177.78">directly valuable to the end merchants by including</span> <span data-start="177.78" data-end="180.54">a payment method called 'basic card,' which was designed</span> <span data-start="180.83" data-end="183.45">to give merchants a direct alternative to</span> <span data-start="183.83" data-end="185.12">form-based credit card payments.</span> <span data-start="186.17" data-end="188.84">With 'basic card,' customers can just select a credit card</span> <span data-start="189.09" data-end="191.25">stored in the browser to make payments.</span> <span data-start="192.17" data-end="194.76">We've learned that building a compelling payment flow</span> <span data-start="194.84" data-end="197.39">requires much more than just returning a credit card</span> <span data-start="197.55" data-end="198.55">number.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="198.8" data-end="201.47">That's why we are switching gears to focus on enabling</span> <span data-start="201.93" data-end="203.89">payment apps through the Web Payments APIs.</span> <span data-start="205.02" data-end="207.73">This means freezing future development on Chrome's built-in</span> <span data-start="208.06" data-end="211.19">basic-card support for now except bug fixes, and</span> <span data-start="211.27" data-end="213.9">eventually deprecating the support for basic card.</span> <span data-start="214.99" data-end="218.32">Today, to complete a payment on the Web, a user often</span> <span data-start="218.32" data-end="221.41">has to fill a long form and follow multiple steps</span> <span data-start="221.53" data-end="223.12">through pop-ups and redirects.</span> <span data-start="225.12" data-end="227.96">Web Payments APIs enable a much more streamlined flow where</span> <span data-start="227.96" data-end="230.54">a user can complete all payment steps without leaving</span> <span data-start="231.09" data-end="232.8">the context of the checkout page.</span> <span data-start="233.63" data-end="236.47">For developers, building an equivalent payment flow</span> <span data-start="236.51" data-end="239.59">requires intricate cross-site coordination using</span> <span data-start="239.8" data-end="241.6">iframes, cookies, and postMessages.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="243.56" data-end="245.93">Some of these mechanisms are being phased out by</span> <span data-start="246.6" data-end="249.52">browser vendors as they are also easily abused</span> <span data-start="249.69" data-end="252.23">by trackers that invade users' privacy.</span> <span data-start="253.98" data-end="257.11">The Web Payments APIs provide a consistent and robust</span> <span data-start="257.2" data-end="260.28">alternative for managing such coordinations, and we are</span> <span data-start="260.28" data-end="262.91">working hard to ensure compatibility with the evolving</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="263.49" data-end="264.79">Web Privacy landscape.</span> <span data-start="267.33" data-end="269.87">Until browser interoperatbility is improved, we recommend</span> <span data-start="270.08" data-end="273.13">that most merchants integrate with payment apps using</span> <span data-start="273.13" data-end="274.59">their recommended approach.</span> <span data-start="275.55" data-end="278.13">The payment apps will take care of leveraging the Web</span> <span data-start="278.13" data-end="280.89">Payments APIs where available and appropriate,</span> <span data-start="281.47" data-end="284.26">and gracefully falling back to alternatives elsewhere.</span> <span data-start="285.14" data-end="287.23">Now, what's new in the Web Payments?</span> <span data-start="287.85" data-end="290.73">Let me cover four exciting new functionalities today.</span> <span data-start="291.85" data-end="294.36">Skip-the-sheet is a UX optimization</span> <span data-start="294.82" data-end="297.78">that allows the user to skip directly to a payment</span> <span data-start="297.78" data-end="300.36">app if there is only one eligible choice.</span> <span data-start="301.2" data-end="304.24">This provides a more streamlined flow for payment apps</span> <span data-start="304.49" data-end="306.83">that are launched from branded buttons.</span> <span data-start="308.08" data-end="310.87">Delegation is a new feature in the Payment Handler API</span> <span data-start="311.29" data-end="314">that allows a payment app to provide all the information</span> <span data-start="314.13" data-end="316.92">requested by the merchant, including shipping and contact</span> <span data-start="317.34" data-end="318.34">information.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="318.97" data-end="321.93">Previously, this information used to always come from the</span> <span data-start="321.97" data-end="322.97">browser.</span> <span data-start="323.47" data-end="326.76">This enhances the capability for a payment app to handle</span> <span data-start="326.81" data-end="328.89">the entirety of a payment flow.</span> <span data-start="329.73" data-end="332.4">Together, delegation and skip-the-sheet enable payment</span> <span data-start="332.77" data-end="335.86">apps to more easily transition their existing</span> <span data-start="335.86" data-end="337.82">flows to the Payment Handler API.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="338.78" data-end="341.57">Another experimental feature that I'm excited about</span> <span data-start="341.78" data-end="343.16">is a Digital Goods API.</span> <span data-start="343.99" data-end="346.62">It is designed to be used together with the Payment Request</span> <span data-start="346.66" data-end="348.58">API to allow web apps to invoke billing</span> <span data-start="349.75" data-end="352.96">flows provided by native app stores to provide</span> <span data-start="353.08" data-end="356.13">in-app-purchase experiences that are difficult</span> <span data-start="356.13" data-end="357.55">to achieve on the web today.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="358.42" data-end="361.26">For example, the Digital Goods API can be used</span> <span data-start="361.38" data-end="363.84">to enable payments for apps in the Play Store that</span> <span data-start="364.43" data-end="365.85">use Trusted Web Activities.</span> <span data-start="366.89" data-end="369.93">Last, but not least, we have made WebAuthn available in</span> <span data-start="369.93" data-end="373.1">the Payment Handler UI so that payment apps can use</span> <span data-start="373.14" data-end="375.69">a biometric sensor to let users sign-in or authorize</span> <span data-start="376.44" data-end="377.44">payments.</span> <span data-start="377.94" data-end="381.07">We also believe WebAuthn is a critical technology to</span> <span data-start="381.11" data-end="384.07">enable low-friction payment authorization on the</span> <span data-start="384.07" data-end="387.28">web and eventually replace today's browser</span> <span data-start="387.28" data-end="388.99">fingerprinting based solutions.</span> <span data-start="389.7" data-end="392.62">We are actively exploring a tighter integration</span> <span data-start="392.71" data-end="394.58">between WebAuthn and Web Payments.</span> <span data-start="395.33" data-end="398.42">In this video, we have looked back at what is Web Payments,</span> <span data-start="398.75" data-end="401.92">why has the focus shifted to payment apps, and what's</span> <span data-start="401.92" data-end="402.92">coming next.</span> </p>
