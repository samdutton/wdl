data-end="40.559">misses the mark in performance we wanted</span> <span data-start="40.559" data-end="42.54">to change this and so even before Cova</span> <span data-start="42.54" data-end="43.86">did we started working with the zoom</span> <span data-start="43.86" data-end="46.05">team to understand exactly what changes</span> <span data-start="46.05" data-end="47.76">they would need and what new

data-end="59.94">without talking about WebRTC WebRTC is a</span> <span data-start="59.94" data-end="62.219">really great full-stack solution that</span> <span data-start="62.219"

zoom would rather want a</span> <span data-start="89.28" data-end="92.429">set of more simple low-level api's that</span> <span data-start="92.429" data-end="93.479">they can then build their

data-end="118.53">early parts of it and by the time you're</span> <span data-start="118.53" data-end="119.879">watching this it might be in the future</span> <span data-start="119.879" data-end="122.099">and you'll be able to actually use these</span> <span data-start="122.099" data-end="124.11">directly and lock already shipped so</span> <span data-start="124.11" data-end="125.67">first of all I want to talk about</span> <span data-start="125.67" data-end="127.649">webassembly sim D and how it can provide</span> <span data-start="127.649"

enables</span> <span data-start="299.61" data-end="301.53">easy two-way communication with</span> <span data-start="301.53" data-end="304.53">something like HTTP the connection has</span> <span data-start="304.53" data-end="306.18">to be initiated by the client and you</span> <span data-start="306.18" data-end="308.76">have to send all of the requests at once</span> <span data-start="308.76" data-end="310.38">and then wait for a response</span> <span data-start="310.38" data-end="312.6">with web transport you don't have these</span> <span data-start="312.6" data-end="314.669">limitations

<span data-start="326.1" data-end="328.59">datagrams are similar to UDP data grams</span> <span data-start="328.59" data-end="330.84">in that they are packets of information</span> <span

data-end="340.44">streams in contrast are similar to TCP</span> <span data-start="340.44" data-end="342.96">streams and provide reliable and ordered</span> <span data-start="342.96" data-end="346.62">data communication so now that we have</span> <span data-start="346.62" data-end="348.33">an understanding of the definition of</span> <span data-start="348.33" data-end="350.34">web

exactly</span> <span data-start="360.06" data-end="362.1">why zoom is interested in looking into</span> <span data-start="362.1" data-end="365.25">web transport because it'll allow them</span> <span

data-start="516.599" data-end="519.18">stream or signal while many of us have</span> <span data-start="519.18" data-end="521.19">not worked directly with codecs we've</span> <span data-start="521.19" data-end="523.94">all seen common examples like mp3 vp9</span> <span data-start="523.94" data-end="526.89">h.264 and many others codecs are</span> <span data-start="526.89" data-end="528.51">actually used in tons of places</span> <span data-start="528.51" data-end="530.82">throughout chrome such as the audio and</span> <span data-start="530.82" data-end="533.55">video tags Web Audio WebRTC and the</span> <span data-start="533.55" data-end="536.67">media recorder API however in all these</span> <span data-start="536.67" data-end="538.529">places where it's used you can't really</span> <span data-start="538.529" data-end="541.38">configure and get pure access to just a</span> <span data-start="541.38" data-end="544.17">codec part for example Web Audio allows</span> <span data-start="544.17" data-end="546.449">for decoding a media file but needs to</span> <span data-start="546.449" data-end="547.26">work on the complete</span> <span data-start="547.26" data-end="548.73">file and doesn't support a streaming</span> <span data-start="548.73" data-end="551.64">based approach media recorder has some</span> <span data-start="551.64" data-end="553.44">controls but they're very high level and</span> <span data-start="553.44" data-end="555.69">you can't really configure it to support</span> <span data-start="555.69" data-end="558.48">extremely low latency use cases as</span> <span data-start="558.48" data-end="560.58">mentioned previously WebRTC does give</span> <span data-start="560.58" data-end="564.66">you a lot of this control but it needs</span> <span data-start="564.66" data-end="566.19">you to bring the whole package of WebRTC</span> <span data-start="566.19" data-end="568.74">along and without doing that it's hard</span> <span data-start="568.74" data-end="570.51">to get access to just the encoding and</span> <span data-start="570.51" data-end="574.23">decoding parts that you want as a result</span> <span data-start="574.23" data-end="576.36">of this lack of configuration some apps</span> <span data-start="576.36" data-end="578.67">have started compiling these codecs to</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="578.67" data-end="581.07">JavaScript and web assembly some of you</span> <span data-start="581.07" data-end="582.27">may remember that this is how the</span> <span data-start="582.27" data-end="584.43">awesome application screw Sh lets you</span> <span data-start="584.43" data-end="588.27">resize and we encode images this</span> <span data-start="588.27" data-end="589.89">approach is really cool and workable</span> <span data-start="589.89" data-end="592.61">today but has some specific drawbacks</span> <span data-start="592.61" data-end="594.75">specifically it increases your bundle</span> <span data-start="594.75" data-end="597.42">size lowers your the performance cause a</span> <span data-start="597.42" data-end="599.7">slower startup time and reduces the</span> <span data-start="599.7" data-end="602.22">power efficiency really what you want is</span> <span data-start="602.22" data-end="603.72">to avoid shipping these codecs all</span> <span data-start="603.72" data-end="605.94">together and just get the direct access</span> <span data-start="605.94" data-end="607.8">that you need through the codecs that</span> <span data-start="607.8" data-end="609.06">are already shipping as part of the</span> <span data-start="609.06" data-end="612.72">browser and that's exactly what the goal</span> <span data-start="612.72" data-end="614.52">of web codecs is and in their own words</span> <span data-start="614.52" data-end="617.22">the goal of web codecs is to provide web</span> <span data-start="617.22" data-end="619.08">apps with efficient access to built-in</span> <span data-start="619.08" data-end="621.12">both software and hardware media</span> <span data-start="621.12" data-end="623.31">encoders and decoders for encoding and</span> <span data-start="623.31" data-end="625.95">decoding media web codecs main advantage</span> <span data-start="625.95" data-end="628.14">is that it lets you get the direct</span> <span data-start="628.14" data-end="630.15">access that you need to again build your</span> <span data-start="630.15" data-end="632.1">own systems on top of the basic coding</span> <span data-start="632.1" data-end="635.52">access this completely unlocks some use</span> <span data-start="635.52" data-end="637.83">cases like video editing since you</span> <span data-start="637.83" data-end="639.81">really need that frame-by-frame access</span> <span data-start="639.81" data-end="641.61">and faster than real time encoding and</span> <span data-start="641.61" data-end="643.59">decoding to do this properly something</span> <span data-start="643.59" data-end="644.85">that's currently completely impossible</span> <span data-start="644.85" data-end="645.98">on the web platform</span> <span data-start="645.98" data-end="648.18">except for maybe shipping codecs with</span> <span data-start="648.18" data-end="651.06">web assembly additionally many existing</span> <span data-start="651.06" data-end="652.62">things that are possible today on the</span> <span data-start="652.62" data-end="655.71">web but only if you use WebRTC things</span> <span data-start="655.71" data-end="657.75">like cloud gaming live streaming and</span> <span data-start="657.75" data-end="659.58">video conferencing will get more</span> <span data-start="659.58" data-end="661.77">flexibility about how they can interact</span> <span data-start="661.77" data-end="664.71">with these codecs zoom for example is</span> <span data-start="664.71" data-end="666.33">looking into using this API in</span> <span data-start="666.33" data-end="668.15">conjunction with the web transport API</span> <span data-start="668.15" data-end="670.34">they're hoping that they'll be able to</span> <span data-start="670.34" data-end="673.38">take encoded video frames and send them</span> <span data-start="673.38" data-end="675.45">up to the server using web transport at</span> <span data-start="675.45" data-end="677.25">the same time that they'll be fetching</span> <span data-start="677.25" data-end="679.65">down encoded frames and then decoding</span> <span data-start="679.65" data-end="680.43">them to</span> <span data-start="680.43" data-end="682.589">to the client providing a really smooth</span> <span data-start="682.589" data-end="685.2">integrated experience next let's look at</span> <span data-start="685.2" data-end="686.82">some of the simple examples for how you</span> <span data-start="686.82" data-end="690.66">can use the decoder part of this here in</span> <span data-start="690.66" data-end="692.49">this canvas setup part we're really just</span> <span data-start="692.49" data-end="695.97">grabbing a canvases context and then</span> <span data-start="695.97" data-end="698.85">making this very simple function to</span> <span data-start="698.85" data-end="702.81">paint a video frame to that canvas from</span> <span data-start="702.81" data-end="706.14">converting it to an image bitmap now</span> <span data-start="706.14" data-end="708.24">when you want to set up the decoder part</span> <span data-start="708.24" data-end="710.22">you just call this new video decoder</span> <span data-start="710.22" data-end="711.899">element and you set up the output</span> <span data-start="711.899" data-end="713.58">function that we defined previously as</span> <span data-start="713.58" data-end="715.23">well as just constant logging out any</span> <span data-start="715.23" data-end="717.6">errors then you configure it with the</span> <span data-start="717.6" data-end="719.91">codec that you want to use and then you</span> <span data-start="719.91" data-end="721.41">have this incredibly simple function</span> <span data-start="721.41" data-end="723.27">that you just pass in your ending coded</span> <span data-start="723.27" data-end="725.04">chunk and called the decode function</span> <span data-start="725.04" data-end="727.589">from your video decoder and then it does</span> <span data-start="727.589" data-end="731.58">the rest of the work for you web codecs</span> <span data-start="731.58" data-end="733.5">is still extremely new but for those of</span> <span data-start="733.5" data-end="735.149">you who are curious you can go and check</span> <span data-start="735.149" data-end="736.68">out the explainer to see what the team</span> <span data-start="736.68" data-end="738.66">is currently working on we will also be</span> <span data-start="738.66" data-end="741.36">doing a web dev post about web codecs so</span> <span data-start="741.36" data-end="742.649">if you're seeing this in the future be</span> <span data-start="742.649" data-end="744.3">sure to go and check out that and that</span> <span data-start="744.3" data-end="745.92">brings us to our overview of these three</span> <span data-start="745.92" data-end="747.42">new exciting api's that we've been</span> <span data-start="747.42" data-end="749.1">exploring with zoom you've hopefully</span> <span data-start="749.1" data-end="751.02">getting a better understanding of some</span> <span data-start="751.02" data-end="753.36">of these new and advanced API s and</span> <span data-start="753.36" data-end="755.22">hopefully an understanding of how they</span> <span data-start="755.22" data-end="757.23">will be bringing all of us closer</span> <span data-start="757.23" data-end="759.54">together in the future thank you so much</span> <span data-start="759.54" data-end="761.279">for your time and I hope you enjoy the</span>
