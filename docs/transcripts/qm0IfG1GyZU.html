<p><span data-start="13" data-end="15.67">Hi, I'm Una, a Developer Advocate on the Chrome team,</span> <span data-start="15.67" data-end="17.34">focusing on CSS and Web UX.</span> <span data-start="18.3" data-end="20.97">Thank you for joining me today. I am super excited to get</span> <span data-start="20.97" data-end="23.93">started and talk about some magical lines of CSS that</span> <span data-start="23.93" data-end="26.68">do some serious heavy lifting and let you build a robust</span> <span data-start="27.31" data-end="28.31">modern layouts.</span> <span data-start="28.64" data-end="31.44">Before we dive into that, there are a couple of key terms</span> <span data-start="31.64" data-end="34.23">that will help you in your styling journeys and are super</span> <span data-start="34.23" data-end="36.86">good to know about as we walk through these techniques.</span> <span data-start="37.53" data-end="39.74">Most of the items I mentioning today are used in</span> <span data-start="39.74" data-end="42.07">conjunction with grid or flexbox layout, and you</span> <span data-start="42.78" data-end="45.12">can denote those as display:grid or display:flex</span> <span data-start="45.91" data-end="46.91">on the parent element.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="47.66" data-end="50.16">The first key terms are fr and auto.</span> <span data-start="50.45" data-end="53.17">These are used with grid layouts to denote fractional units</span> <span data-start="53.17" data-end="55.67">of space — that's fr, or automatic space — that's</span> <span data-start="56.25" data-end="59.42">auto — based on the minimum content size of the items</span> <span data-start="59.42" data-end="61.88">within that element. For grid layout, we also have</span> <span data-start="62.38" data-end="65.3">the minmax() function, which let's us set a minimum</span> <span data-start="65.34" data-end="67.89">and maximum value within our layout bounds to enable</span> <span data-start="68.26" data-end="70.06">responsive design without media queries!</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="70.64" data-end="73.27">We also have separate min(), max(), and clamp() functions</span> <span data-start="73.27" data-end="75.9">available in some browsers that bring logic to CSS.</span> <span data-start="77.06" data-end="79.65">The browser determines which value to choose based on the</span> <span data-start="79.65" data-end="82.32">function provided for min and max, and for clamp, we'd</span> <span data-start="82.7" data-end="85.82">set both a min and max, with a relative value in between.</span> <span data-start="86.28" data-end="88.58">We'll definitely be covering these within the video with a</span> <span data-start="88.62" data-end="89.58">demo.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="89.58" data-end="92.37">And within these layouts, we can also use auto-fit or</span> <span data-start="92.46" data-end="95.33">auto-fill to automatically place child elements</span> <span data-start="95.42" data-end="96.42">into a parent grid.</span> <span data-start="96.83" data-end="99.38">This is another tool for dynamic, responsive layouts</span> <span data-start="99.8" data-end="101.21">without media queries.</span> <span data-start="101.63" data-end="104.51">We're going to be going over all of those terms and more</span> <span data-start="104.72" data-end="106.05">with demos galore.</span> <span data-start="106.72" data-end="108.72">I'm really big nerd and I don't know why I made that rhyme</span> <span data-start="108.72" data-end="110.72">and put that in this video, but I did so..</span> <span data-start="111.1" data-end="113.93">So let's just dive into the demos and 1-line</span> <span data-start="114.19" data-end="116.94">layouts. I made a handy little site called 1-Line</span> <span data-start="117.1" data-end="119.61">Layouts at 1linelayouts.glitch.me</span> <span data-start="120.07" data-end="122.65">so that you can follow along or play on your own and have a</span> <span data-start="122.65" data-end="125.74">reference for the power that CSS can bring to your layouts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="126.57" data-end="129.37">For our first 'single-line' layout, let's solve the biggest</span> <span data-start="129.37" data-end="132.62">mystery in all the CSS land: centering things.</span> <span data-start="132.87" data-end="134.75">I want you know it's easier than you think with</span> <span data-start="135.21" data-end="137.46">place-items:center, I call this the Definitely</span> <span data-start="138.33" data-end="139.5">Centered Layout.</span> <span data-start="139.84" data-end="142.96">What we need to do is first specify the layout method,</span> <span data-start="143.01" data-end="145.55">which is display grid here, and then we are going to write</span> <span data-start="145.55" data-end="147.8">'place-items: center' This is that one magical</span> <span data-start="148.76" data-end="151.35">line of code and I have these highlighted under the titles</span> <span data-start="151.35" data-end="153.89">here. So what happens here is no matter what you put</span> <span data-start="154.48" data-end="157.77">in here, it is going to stay centered to that parent</span> <span data-start="157.85" data-end="160.98">element. So if we look at the HTML we have</span> <span data-start="160.98" data-end="163.61">this parent and it's just getting background blue and then</span> <span data-start="163.61" data-end="166.49">this child with a coral background and it's contenteditable</span> <span data-start="166.49" data-end="169.37">so we can actually just type in here — we can have vertical</span> <span data-start="169.66" data-end="172.95">content, 'Hello, world' — and even as I'm typing,</span> <span data-start="173.2" data-end="176.29">this child element is staying centered within</span> <span data-start="176.37" data-end="179.33">the parent box. So I think that this is a really cool</span> <span data-start="179.33" data-end="182">technique. 'place-item: center' will solve all of your</span> <span data-start="182" data-end="183.21">centered dilemmas.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="183.96" data-end="186.01">Next, we have the deconstructive pancake!</span> <span data-start="186.38" data-end="188.68">This is something that we see all the time on marketing</span> <span data-start="188.68" data-end="192.18">sites. You see this row of 3 items and usually</span> <span data-start="192.18" data-end="194.77">on mobile, we'll want that to be stacked, which is why I</span> <span data-start="194.77" data-end="197.18">called this the pancake stack, but deconstructed,</span> <span data-start="197.85" data-end="199.35">because as you increase the size</span> <span data-start="201.06" data-end="204.32">of the viewport, those items will start spanning into</span> <span data-start="204.32" data-end="207.28">the same line. So it starts when they're all on</span> <span data-start="207.28" data-end="209.66">top of each other and then they start to deconstruct as you</span> <span data-start="209.66" data-end="211.7">increase the size of the viewport.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="212.12" data-end="215.33">So the way that we're going to be doing this one is using</span> <span data-start="215.33" data-end="217.66">the shorthand for flexbox — 'flex: 0 1 ' — is</span> <span data-start="219.08" data-end="221.5">what we will be using for this look that you're seeing</span> <span data-start="221.54" data-end="222.92">right now without the stretching.</span> <span data-start="223.29" data-end="225.92">But if we did want to stretch, we can set that to 'flex: 1</span> <span data-start="226.34" data-end="227.84">1 '. And the reason</span> <span data-start="229.34" data-end="232.26">why we do this is is because the flex shorthands stands for</span> <span data-start="232.26" data-end="233.26">flex-grow, flex-shrink, and then flex-basis.</span> <span data-start="236.47" data-end="238.93">So again, here we have 'flex: 0 1 150px'.</span> <span data-start="239.81" data-end="242.4">That is the basis here. So as we increase the size, it</span> <span data-start="242.73" data-end="245.4">is not going to be growing much.</span> <span data-start="245.69" data-end="247.4">Also, when we decrease it is going to be staying within</span> <span data-start="247.57" data-end="248.69">that 150px size.</span> <span data-start="248.86" data-end="251.53">When we do change that to 1, I'm just going to delete this</span> <span data-start="251.53" data-end="254.28">line of code here — now we see that this is going to be</span> <span data-start="254.28" data-end="257.49">stretching. So here you can see that it stretches to fill</span> <span data-start="257.49" data-end="258.95">the space even as it wraps.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="259.2" data-end="262.29">And as I increase it to be even larger of viewport size,</span> <span data-start="262.5" data-end="264.5">these items are going to be filling that space.</span> <span data-start="264.75" data-end="267.38">So this is the deconstructive pancake, a really common</span> <span data-start="267.76" data-end="269.34">technique that we see in marketing sites.</span> <span data-start="269.63" data-end="271.93">This is usually going to be like an image with some text</span> <span data-start="271.93" data-end="274.68">about the product and you can write it by using the flex</span> <span data-start="275.05" data-end="276.06">shorthand.</span> <span data-start="276.64" data-end="279.89">I like to call this one Sidebar Says and it takes advantage</span> <span data-start="279.89" data-end="282.65">of that minmax() function for grid layouts.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="282.9" data-end="284.19">So that is this line here.</span> <span data-start="284.27" data-end="287.4">We have grid-template-columns, minmax, and then</span> <span data-start="287.48" data-end="289.69">min and max value.</span> <span data-start="290.07" data-end="291.11">That's pretty straightforward with minmax.</span> <span data-start="291.82" data-end="294.87">But what this is doing is essentially as we're increasing</span> <span data-start="294.87" data-end="297.74">the size of the viewport, it's going to be taking that 25%</span> <span data-start="298.29" data-end="299.54">size, that max size.</span> <span data-start="299.75" data-end="302.79">And as we decrease it, it hits this point where its 150px</span> <span data-start="304.42" data-end="307.09">and where 25% is smaller than 150px,</span> <span data-start="307.84" data-end="310.38">so it's going to clamp it at that minimum size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="310.63" data-end="313.3">So it's going to be increasing when it can take up that</span> <span data-start="313.55" data-end="316.14">viewport space, but if we have content in here that we</span> <span data-start="316.14" data-end="318.93">don't want squeezed or we want to stop being 25%</span> <span data-start="319.56" data-end="322.73">and at a minimum be 150px or whatever value</span> <span data-start="322.73" data-end="325.02">we set here, then that is exactly what minmax()</span> <span data-start="325.69" data-end="326.86">is doing for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="327.11" data-end="329.4">And in the grid-template-columns here we are writing</span> <span data-start="329.69" data-end="332.19">grid-template-columns, minmax, that face value, and</span> <span data-start="332.78" data-end="335.11">then the relative value, so 25%, and that second</span> <span data-start="335.86" data-end="338.7">element is getting 1 fr. So if we look at HTML, we have</span> <span data-start="338.7" data-end="341.54">these two elements, this yellow side bar section, and then</span> <span data-start="341.54" data-end="343.08">this purple content section.</span> <span data-start="343.29" data-end="345.92">And they are taking up the units of space that we are</span> <span data-start="345.92" data-end="348.54">specifying. In this specific case, we actually even set</span> <span data-start="348.54" data-end="351.17">this to auto, and it would be looking the same because</span> <span data-start="351.63" data-end="354.3">we are only saying the size to that first elements.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="354.63" data-end="357.64">We're gonna go over auto versus 1 fr in the next example,</span> <span data-start="358.18" data-end="359.64">but I think that this is pretty neat.</span> <span data-start="359.68" data-end="361.81">A great way to set a minimum size, but then</span> <span data-start="362.81" data-end="365.85">let your elements stretch on larger viewports to</span> <span data-start="365.85" data-end="368.52">fit those layouts a little bit better, based on how</span> <span data-start="369.4" data-end="371.36">your user is seeing your website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="372.15" data-end="374.15">Next, we have the pancake stack.</span> <span data-start="374.49" data-end="377.45">Unlike the deconstructive pancake, this one does not shift</span> <span data-start="377.66" data-end="379.91">when the screen changes sizes.</span> <span data-start="380.2" data-end="383">This is a very common layout that we see for both</span> <span data-start="383.25" data-end="385.75">websites and applications across mobile and desktop</span> <span data-start="386.54" data-end="389.17">functions. So it looks like this, as we're increasing</span> <span data-start="389.92" data-end="391.13">and decreasing the size.</span> <span data-start="391.46" data-end="393.46">This content is not changing.</span> <span data-start="393.76" data-end="396.55">And what we are doing to create this is we are writing the</span> <span data-start="396.55" data-end="399.09">grid-template-rows to be auto, 1fr,</span> <span data-start="400.39" data-end="402.6">and auto. So what we are doing is essentially</span> <span data-start="403.43" data-end="406.48">telling the first and last row to take up</span> <span data-start="406.64" data-end="409.48">the space that the internal elements allow.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="409.48" data-end="412.32">So if this header was two lines, then it's going to</span> <span data-start="412.32" data-end="415.15">increasingly take up more space within this</span> <span data-start="415.32" data-end="416.45">vertical layout.</span> <span data-start="417.07" data-end="419.49">With this auto section, I could have more content</span> <span data-start="420.07" data-end="423.12">here, but it's not going to increase the size because</span> <span data-start="423.12" data-end="426.54">what we're doing is setting the auto placed</span> <span data-start="426.66" data-end="429.5">row first to take up that specific size based</span> <span data-start="430.08" data-end="431.25">on the content within it.</span> <span data-start="431.46" data-end="434.51">And then the remaining space is remaining fractional units.</span> <span data-start="434.92" data-end="437.72">So as we increase this also vertically, you could</span> <span data-start="438.05" data-end="441.09">see that the first and last row are not</span> <span data-start="441.09" data-end="443.89">growing. They're still only gonna be taking the size that</span> <span data-start="443.89" data-end="446.89">they need, but if I decrease the horizontal space</span> <span data-start="446.93" data-end="449.85">as footer content moves onto the next line, it is going</span> <span data-start="449.85" data-end="452.19">to be taking space up within that layout.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="452.48" data-end="455.48">So with 'grid-template-rows: auto, 1fr, auto' you can</span> <span data-start="455.48" data-end="457.69">create the pancake stack. You could even have an</span> <span data-start="457.74" data-end="459.11">application toolbar down there.</span> <span data-start="459.66" data-end="462.78">Again, this is one that we see really commonly and</span> <span data-start="463.12" data-end="464.79">grid-template-rows is a great one to know.</span> <span data-start="465.49" data-end="468.5">Another very common layout is the Holy Grail layout.</span> <span data-start="468.54" data-end="470.04">Does this look familiar?</span> <span data-start="470.46" data-end="473.17">I think we've all seen a website or two that looks exactly</span> <span data-start="473.17" data-end="475.71">like this at some point on our web journey.</span> <span data-start="475.92" data-end="478.67">We've got your header, your footer, your</span> <span data-start="478.92" data-end="481.97">left sidebar over here, your main content and a right</span> <span data-start="481.97" data-end="484.89">sidebar. And we can write all of this</span> <span data-start="484.97" data-end="486.89">in one line of code using grid-template.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="487.72" data-end="490.77">So grid-template allows us to write the</span> <span data-start="490.77" data-end="492.73">grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns</span> <span data-start="494.06" data-end="495.57">at the same time.</span> <span data-start="495.9" data-end="498.4">So that's pretty neat. It's also super responsive.</span> <span data-start="498.4" data-end="501.32">Again, you see this auto content taking up</span> <span data-start="501.45" data-end="504.49">what we are specifying here internally and then</span> <span data-start="504.49" data-end="506.37">this main content taking up the 1fr.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="507.08" data-end="509.41">And so what we are specifying here is grid-template</span> <span data-start="510.37" data-end="513.5">with auto, 1fr for this middle space,</span> <span data-start="513.54" data-end="514.84">and then auto for the footer.</span> <span data-start="515.09" data-end="518.34">And then we've got our columns of auto, 1fr, and auto.</span> <span data-start="518.67" data-end="521.68">So you get the whole Holy Grail layout with</span> <span data-start="521.72" data-end="524.05">'grid-template: auto 1fr auto / auto 1fr auto'.</span> <span data-start="525.05" data-end="527.14">This slash is what denotes our rows versus</span> <span data-start="528.18" data-end="531.23">columns when we are writing the grid templates.</span> <span data-start="531.64" data-end="533.85">So I think that this one is great to know.</span> <span data-start="533.85" data-end="536.32">Grid-template is something that I use all the time.</span> <span data-start="536.69" data-end="538.53">This is not exactly one line.</span> <span data-start="538.57" data-end="540.49">I mean, all of these, you know, you have a little bit more</span> <span data-start="540.49" data-end="543.24">to add. But with this, when you are ready in grid-template,</span> <span data-start="543.91" data-end="545.82">you can then specify grid-columns</span> <span data-start="547.03" data-end="548.58">and grid-rows for each of these</span> <span data-start="550.12" data-end="552.79">elements. So here I am specifying what grid-column I am</span> <span data-start="552.79" data-end="554.54">placing the header in.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="554.58" data-end="556.88">I'm going all the way across all three.</span> <span data-start="556.88" data-end="559.96">So 1 / 4 to get those grid tracks from</span> <span data-start="559.96" data-end="561.47">the first track to the last track.</span> <span data-start="561.84" data-end="564.59">And then the left side, we have it going inside the first,</span> <span data-start="564.59" data-end="565.89">so from 1 to 2.</span> <span data-start="566.55" data-end="569.06">This main section going from 2 to 3.</span> <span data-start="569.77" data-end="571.77">So that's gonna be taking up the middle section and then</span> <span data-start="571.77" data-end="574.52">the right side is from 3 to 4, so that's going all the way</span> <span data-start="574.52" data-end="576.98">to the end of this grid that we've created.</span> <span data-start="577.4" data-end="579.23">And then for that footer, it's going all the way across</span> <span data-start="579.23" data-end="582.4">just like the header. So you do specify where</span> <span data-start="582.4" data-end="585.61">items are placed when it is a little more of a complex</span> <span data-start="585.61" data-end="588.83">UI. And in here, if we look at the HTML, I have</span> <span data-start="588.95" data-end="592.75">this parent, then I have header, then I have left-sidebar,</span> <span data-start="593.16" data-end="596.75">then I have the main section, right section</span> <span data-start="596.92" data-end="598.34">and then the footer.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="598.46" data-end="601.46">So you can write all of your layouts in one line</span> <span data-start="601.51" data-end="603.8">using grid-template property.</span> <span data-start="604.51" data-end="607.01">Next we have another classic the 12-by or 12-span</span> <span data-start="607.93" data-end="610.18">grid. You can quickly write grids in CSS using</span> <span data-start="610.89" data-end="611.89">the repeat() grid function.</span> <span data-start="612.93" data-end="616.27">And here we're setting a repeat of 12 columns.</span> <span data-start="616.44" data-end="617.56">So that looks like this grid-template-columns, repeat</span> <span data-start="619.56" data-end="621.78">- the number that you want to repeat — and then 1fr.</span> <span data-start="622.48" data-end="624.61">So this would be the same as writing</span> <span data-start="624.61" data-end="627.24">'grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr'</span> <span data-start="627.74" data-end="630.58">twelve times, but because I don't want to do that, I'm just</span> <span data-start="630.58" data-end="633.7">going to write repeat, 12, and then 1fr and then</span> <span data-start="633.75" data-end="635.79">we have a 12-by grid.</span> <span data-start="636.16" data-end="639.21">So now we can place our items within this grid</span> <span data-start="639.42" data-end="642.13">however we want. If we want it to span all the way across</span> <span data-start="642.13" data-end="644.76">the 12 columns, we would use this span 12</span> <span data-start="645.42" data-end="648.22">element. I just gave it a span12 class and have it going</span> <span data-start="648.22" data-end="651.56">from 1 all the way to 13, so taking up the full space</span> <span data-start="651.72" data-end="654.1">of the 12 columns ending at the grid track of 13,</span> <span data-start="654.98" data-end="658.19">which would be the end of that 12th column line.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="658.35" data-end="661.44">For the span6, this is going from one to seven.</span> <span data-start="661.73" data-end="663.9">For span4 this is going from 4 to 8.</span> <span data-start="664.36" data-end="667.61">It can go anywhere. I could start this at the first line</span> <span data-start="667.65" data-end="668.66">and make it go all the way to 9.</span> <span data-start="669.03" data-end="671.16">I could have this go to 5 and have it still span 4.</span> <span data-start="671.53" data-end="674.16">But the cool thing is you can just place this wherever you</span> <span data-start="674.16" data-end="675.87">want inside of your UI.</span> <span data-start="675.95" data-end="678.46">So if I want to have this start from 6 and go to 10,</span> <span data-start="679" data-end="681.67">I could do that. And then we have this span2, and this</span> <span data-start="682" data-end="684.3">is just going from 3 to 5. Again, that could be placed</span> <span data-start="684.34" data-end="686.84">anywhere. And then a peep at the HTML, we just have</span> <span data-start="687.38" data-end="690.34">this parent element, and then the inside of</span> <span data-start="690.34" data-end="692.64">here, we're just giving classes based on those span</span> <span data-start="692.93" data-end="695.52">elements that we were just adjusting within that grid</span> <span data-start="695.89" data-end="698.94">template. So the repeat function is very,</span> <span data-start="698.94" data-end="701.44">very useful when you don't want to keep typing out</span> <span data-start="702.06" data-end="703.69">1fr auto multiple times.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="703.94" data-end="706.57">It just lets you quickly write information.</span> <span data-start="707.15" data-end="710.24">We're going to expand on the repeat function for number</span> <span data-start="710.24" data-end="712.32">7. And this technique is super cool, super</span> <span data-start="713.33" data-end="715.91">useful. If you take away anything from this video, I think</span> <span data-start="715.91" data-end="718.25">this would be a great one to keep in your repertoire.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="718.58" data-end="721.25">I like to call this the RAM technique, which stands for</span> <span data-start="721.5" data-end="723.75">repeat, auto, and minmax, and the line of code</span> <span data-start="724.67" data-end="726.05">here, it looks like this. You have the</span> <span data-start="726.05" data-end="728.63">grid-template-columns, repeat, auto-fit, or</span> <span data-start="729.47" data-end="732.68">autofill, minmax, the base value, and then</span> <span data-start="733.55" data-end="735.01">1fr for a fractional unit.</span> <span data-start="735.35" data-end="737.43">And here we have that base value as 150px.</span> <span data-start="738.27" data-end="739.64">I'll show you exactly what's going on.</span> <span data-start="739.94" data-end="742.9">So as we increase the size here, these</span> <span data-start="742.9" data-end="745.48">elements are going to fit to take up the space, these</span> <span data-start="746.27" data-end="749.19">four boxes. As I decrease it, they're going to hit</span> <span data-start="749.53" data-end="752.53">this 150px base value and then</span> <span data-start="752.61" data-end="754.87">they're going to wrap onto the next line.</span> <span data-start="755.12" data-end="756.99">But here we have them auto-fitting, so</span> <span data-start="758.16" data-end="761.33">they're going to be spanning the take up as much space</span> <span data-start="761.37" data-end="763.88">as they can. There's some really cool algorithms at</span> <span data-start="764.42" data-end="767.55">play here. Now, if we change this to</span> <span data-start="767.59" data-end="770.17">auto-fill, this will look a little bit different.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="770.17" data-end="773.09">So let me just update that to auto-fill. Here, now,</span> <span data-start="773.14" data-end="775.14">as I increase the size, it's not going to</span> <span data-start="776.14" data-end="778.64">be spanning and stretching to take up the remainder</span> <span data-start="779.14" data-end="781.73">of the space, it's actually going to be using that 150</span> <span data-start="781.81" data-end="784.02">pixels as a baseline and stay within that.</span> <span data-start="784.44" data-end="786.44">At smaller sizes, there's no difference here.</span> <span data-start="786.69" data-end="789.86">But you really see the difference at larger sizes as</span> <span data-start="789.86" data-end="791.7">you have additional space.</span> <span data-start="791.95" data-end="795.2">And I use this technique on the page that you're looking</span> <span data-start="795.24" data-end="797.58">at here itself, this auto-fill, so</span> <span data-start="798.66" data-end="800.66">that these two segments would stretch and</span> <span data-start="801.62" data-end="805.17">shrink, but not exceed a specific</span> <span data-start="805.17" data-end="806.46">space that I wanted them to.</span> <span data-start="806.46" data-end="809.55">And then I have them centered, so you can center this</span> <span data-start="809.67" data-end="812.88">within the parent as it spreads to a larger size.</span> <span data-start="812.88" data-end="815.59">That's always an option and a really great technique to</span> <span data-start="815.72" data-end="818.18">know. Remember R-A-M,</span> <span data-start="818.85" data-end="821.22">repeat, auto, fill or fit, and then minmax,</span> <span data-start="821.93" data-end="824.44">and you can get these responsive boxes.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="824.6" data-end="826.73">You can use these for images, you can use them for a lot of</span> <span data-start="826.73" data-end="829.82">things. It's something that we see all the time for cards.</span> <span data-start="830.32" data-end="833.53">And this is a great use of all of these fancy new</span> <span data-start="833.74" data-end="834.95">grid capabilities in CSS.</span> <span data-start="835.45" data-end="837.32">For our next layout, we're heading back</span> <span data-start="838.45" data-end="839.78">to flexbox land.</span> <span data-start="840.08" data-end="842.62">I want to include this one because I just find it so useful</span> <span data-start="842.62" data-end="844.12">and I use this all the time.</span> <span data-start="844.41" data-end="846.25">I call it the Line Up. Why?</span> <span data-start="846.46" data-end="848">I don't know. I'm tired.</span> <span data-start="848.17" data-end="849.84">If you have a better name, please let me know.</span> <span data-start="849.88" data-end="851.84">Leave a comment. But the main thing that I wanted to</span> <span data-start="851.84" data-end="853.63">demonstrate here is justify-content</span> <span data-start="855.01" data-end="857.68">for placement of items. And here specifically, I wanted to</span> <span data-start="857.72" data-end="860.43">highlight 'justify-content: space-between' to place</span> <span data-start="860.68" data-end="861.97">items at their edges.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="862.18" data-end="864.85">And so in this example, we have these three cards</span> <span data-start="865.14" data-end="867.6">and you can see that as I'm stretching or shrinking</span> <span data-start="868.19" data-end="870.11">the size of this viewport element, they</span> <span data-start="871.23" data-end="873.74">are maintaining the same height as each other.</span> <span data-start="874.03" data-end="876.86">And in fact, we are having them</span> <span data-start="877.07" data-end="880.45">fit to the top and bottom and this interior</span> <span data-start="880.45" data-end="883.5">content — so this description like, I can keep</span> <span data-start="883.62" data-end="886.92">typing here — this is then going to be centered</span> <span data-start="887.08" data-end="889.17">within the remaining space.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="889.46" data-end="892.92">And so the reason this is happening is because</span> <span data-start="893.09" data-end="895.92">for these cards, we're giving them this flex-direction</span> <span data-start="896.63" data-end="899.47">of 'column'. This display-flex, the flexbox mode,</span> <span data-start="899.72" data-end="901.89">and then we're justifying content space-between.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="902.85" data-end="905.39">So because this is a column for the flex-direction,</span> <span data-start="906.56" data-end="909.56">the space-between is going to be right here in between</span> <span data-start="909.81" data-end="912.4">these three elements; this little box here, the</span> <span data-start="912.4" data-end="913.48">description, and the title.</span> <span data-start="913.94" data-end="917.28">And so here, as I'm having additional space</span> <span data-start="917.36" data-end="920.53">added or removed vertically, they are centering themselves.</span> <span data-start="920.57" data-end="923.83">And this just makes for a much neater layout.</span> <span data-start="923.87" data-end="926.66">I've used this a lot here, without that justification, it</span> <span data-start="926.66" data-end="927.96">looks a lot more messy.</span> <span data-start="928.16" data-end="930.29">But because of the stretching here, because of the flexbox,</span> <span data-start="930.63" data-end="933.04">because of this 'justify-content: space between', I use</span> <span data-start="933.04" data-end="935.92">this all the time and I think it's really important to know</span> <span data-start="936.09" data-end="939.18">that with flexbox you can change the direction</span> <span data-start="939.26" data-end="941.68">and you can justify your content in unique ways.</span> <span data-start="941.68" data-end="943.43">It doesn't have to be just centered.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="943.68" data-end="946.85">You can also do center, you can do a space-around</span> <span data-start="947.73" data-end="948.73">as well or space-evenly.</span> <span data-start="949.52" data-end="952.27">But in this case, I think that the best way to justify is</span> <span data-start="952.61" data-end="955.86">space-between. Because this way we are ensuring</span> <span data-start="956.11" data-end="959.15">that the first and last element here</span> <span data-start="959.53" data-end="962.53">in our layout, which is going to be this H3 and this whole</span> <span data-start="962.57" data-end="965.62">visual box, remain flush</span> <span data-start="965.62" data-end="967.66">to the top and bottom of our cards.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="968.62" data-end="971.25">Here's where we get into some techniques with a little less</span> <span data-start="971.29" data-end="972.67">current browser support.</span> <span data-start="973" data-end="976.09">I like to call this one Clamping My Syle and it's a really</span> <span data-start="976.09" data-end="979.13">neat trick. Remember at the beginning of this video,</span> <span data-start="979.13" data-end="981.01">we talked about min, max and clamp?</span> <span data-start="981.55" data-end="984.6">Well, here's where it can come into play for layout and</span> <span data-start="984.64" data-end="987.6">element style. Here I'm specifying the width</span> <span data-start="987.85" data-end="990.44">using this clamp function and I'm setting clamp to 23ch,</span> <span data-start="990.44" data-end="991.44">50%, and 46ch. What</span> <span data-start="995.19" data-end="997.57">does this do? Let me show you exactly what's going on here.</span> <span data-start="997.94" data-end="1001.03">As I increase the size of this element, the</span> <span data-start="1001.03" data-end="1003.28">parent container here, it is going to increase</span> <span data-start="1004.41" data-end="1005.95">the size of this card.</span> <span data-start="1006.2" data-end="1008.33">And as I decrease it, it decreases it.</span> <span data-start="1008.66" data-end="1012.17">But what we are setting here is a minimum and maximum size</span> <span data-start="1012.42" data-end="1014.25">for it to clamp to as it reaches that</span> <span data-start="1015.46" data-end="1017.17">50% size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1017.42" data-end="1020.05">This card wants to be at 50% width, but</span> <span data-start="1020.63" data-end="1023.13">if that 50% means that it's bigger than 46ch -</span> <span data-start="1024.14" data-end="1027.31">which stands for 46 characters — then</span> <span data-start="1027.35" data-end="1029.6">it's going to stop getting bigger.</span> <span data-start="1029.89" data-end="1032.6">The same thing happens with the smaller viewport size.</span> <span data-start="1032.81" data-end="1035.73">It's going to stop decreasing in size when 50%</span> <span data-start="1036.94" data-end="1039.86">of its parent size means that it is smaller than 23ch</span> <span data-start="1039.9" data-end="1042.4">- which is 23 characters.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1042.82" data-end="1045.45">And these specific character units can be used to make</span> <span data-start="1045.95" data-end="1047.87">legibility a little bit easier.</span> <span data-start="1048.16" data-end="1050.62">So in this case, I don't want this card to get any smaller</span> <span data-start="1050.91" data-end="1053.16">than that because then the paragraph gets harder to read.</span> <span data-start="1053.46" data-end="1056.17">And same thing with getting bigger than 46 characters, then</span> <span data-start="1056.71" data-end="1058.5">it gets too long and hard to read.</span> <span data-start="1058.8" data-end="1062.05">So you can use width, clamp, minimum size,</span> <span data-start="1062.05" data-end="1065.26">the actual size, and the max size to create</span> <span data-start="1065.26" data-end="1068.72">some really cool responsiveness within this element itself.</span> <span data-start="1069.1" data-end="1071.06">And you can also use clamp() for font size.</span> <span data-start="1071.1" data-end="1072.89">That's a really great use case, too.</span> <span data-start="1073.14" data-end="1075.23">You can have this responsive, flexible typography.</span> <span data-start="1075.23" data-end="1076.77">You could have like clamp, 1.5rem,</span> <span data-start="1079.52" data-end="1082.24">and then like say,</span> <span data-start="1082.53" data-end="1085.16">10vw for the viewport width, and then 3rem</span> <span data-start="1086.32" data-end="1087.45">as the biggest size.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1087.7" data-end="1090.74">And that way, as you resize your window, you're</span> <span data-start="1090.74" data-end="1093.75">going to be having a minimum value of</span> <span data-start="1094.29" data-end="1097.17">1.5rem, maximum value of 3rem, and then</span> <span data-start="1097.29" data-end="1100.25">you're gonna have that grow and shrink into that remaining</span> <span data-start="1100.25" data-end="1103.38">space. So it's pretty cool to see this</span> <span data-start="1103.42" data-end="1105.76">actually working in a browser.</span> <span data-start="1105.93" data-end="1108.43">Again, this doesn't have a full browser support,</span> <span data-start="1108.93" data-end="1111.31">but it is a really great technique.</span> <span data-start="1111.39" data-end="1114.06">So if you're using this, make sure the fallbacks and do</span> <span data-start="1114.06" data-end="1115.06">your browser testing.</span> <span data-start="1115.81" data-end="1118.86">And finally, we are at the end and this is the last</span> <span data-start="1118.86" data-end="1121.69">layout tool. And this layout tool is the most experimental</span> <span data-start="1122.15" data-end="1124.49">of the bunch. This is recently introduced to Chrome Canary</span> <span data-start="1125.11" data-end="1126.24">and Chrome 84+.</span> <span data-start="1126.91" data-end="1129.7">And there is an active effort from Firefox in getting this</span> <span data-start="1129.74" data-end="1132.37">implemented in browser, but it is currently not in any</span> <span data-start="1132.62" data-end="1135.5">stable browsers — at the time of this recording.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1135.78" data-end="1137.62">I do want to mention it though, because it is such a</span> <span data-start="1137.62" data-end="1140.3">frequently met problem and it's just simply maintaining</span> <span data-start="1141.09" data-end="1143.13">the aspect ratio of an image or a video or</span> <span data-start="1144.05" data-end="1145.05">of an iframe.</span> <span data-start="1145.47" data-end="1148.43">And so what this is, is respecting</span> <span data-start="1148.51" data-end="1150.01">the aspect, Respect for Aspect.</span> <span data-start="1150.3" data-end="1152.64">That's name I gave it.

Oh, my gosh, I'm going to be so excited when this</span> <span data-start="1156.64" data-end="1158.06">is implemented in all browsers.</span> <span data-start="1158.73" data-end="1162.07">What this is doing is, as I am resizing this</span> <span data-start="1162.07" data-end="1164.98">parent element, the image here</span> <span data-start="1165.07" data-end="1167.61">- so this is just like I gave it a class of visual for this</span> <span data-start="1167.61" data-end="1169.99">box here. That is right here.</span> <span data-start="1170.49" data-end="1173.74">- this is getting an aspect ratio of 16 to 9.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1174.04" data-end="1176.96">And no matter how I increase it or decrease it, it is going</span> <span data-start="1177.21" data-end="1178.79">to keep that aspect ratio.</span> <span data-start="1179" data-end="1181.33">This is something that is so needed for when you</span> <span data-start="1182" data-end="1185.46">are pulling in content from a CMS or otherwise,</span> <span data-start="1185.63" data-end="1188.51">and you have a specific dimension that you have that</span> <span data-start="1188.97" data-end="1189.97">media at.</span> <span data-start="1190.51" data-end="1193.47">And this, for example, in the previous example, if I</span> <span data-start="1193.47" data-end="1196.52">scroll up as I resize here, since I'm only</span> <span data-start="1196.52" data-end="1199.31">setting a height and it's just getting the 100%</span> <span data-start="1199.73" data-end="1202.94">width of whatever remaining space that I'm providing here,</span> <span data-start="1203.44" data-end="1206.07">it's actually changing the aspect ratio of the sole visual</span> <span data-start="1206.07" data-end="1207.9">box. And that's not what we want.</span> <span data-start="1208.65" data-end="1211.66">That is going to make you force a decision on</span> <span data-start="1211.7" data-end="1214.45">if you want to either fit the content inside of there so</span> <span data-start="1214.7" data-end="1216.91">it's smaller and fits within the space, or if</span> <span data-start="1217.75" data-end="1220.25">you stretch it out and you have it fill the content</span> <span data-start="1220.87" data-end="1223.21">and then you're only seeing a piece of that media and not</span> <span data-start="1223.21" data-end="1226.13">the full image — and that's also going to cause all sorts</span> <span data-start="1226.17" data-end="1229.38">of problems. So having this aspect ratio is</span> <span data-start="1229.47" data-end="1231.59">very exciting.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="1231.8" data-end="1234.55">You can also set this to a square if you do 1 over 1.</span> <span data-start="1235.31" data-end="1238.22">You could have this be 1 over 2, where you have this</span> <span data-start="1238.22" data-end="1241.52">actually longer than it is wide within this parent</span> <span data-start="1241.52" data-end="1244.15">here. So that's going to be maintaining that aspect ratio.</span> <span data-start="1244.4" data-end="1246.65">And it's just exciting, so I wanted to mention it and let</span> <span data-start="1246.65" data-end="1248.36">you know that it's coming down the pipeline.</span> <span data-start="1249.53" data-end="1252.49">And those are the 10 really powerful lines of CSS that</span> <span data-start="1252.49" data-end="1253.57">I wanted to talk about in this 1 line layout video.</span> <span data-start="1255.83" data-end="1257.41">I hope that you all learned something new.</span> <span data-start="1257.45" data-end="1259.5">And if you're looking for these demos, check out</span> <span data-start="1261.91" data-end="1263.88">1linelayouts.glitch.me.
