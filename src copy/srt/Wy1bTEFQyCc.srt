[Music]

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,799
hey there welcome to web dev live

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,529
I'm deal now man and I work on the web

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,660
developer ecosystem at Google and I'm

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,920
delighted to kick off our online event

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,180
first though I want to acknowledge the

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,550
times we're in we're dealing with a

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,830
global pandemic that has taken a huge

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,399
toll on us all and most recently we

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,079
witnessed two events which have once

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,600
again surfaced the systemic racism in

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
our society that we must do everything

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,059
we can to eradicate you know these

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,800
events have been really humbling they're

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,210
showing us how much work we have ahead

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,520
of us but they also show us the power of

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,370
community so we join you today and over

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,410
the next three days in the spirit of

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,690
being together and helping each other

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,520
because we're upset when we had to

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,590
cancel Google i/o and I kept thinking

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,719
about an empty Shoreline Amphitheatre on

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,129
the days that some of us would have

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,559
congregated a web developers reached out

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,140
showing these same feelings wishing we

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,820
could be discussing ideas and enjoying

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,830
the hallway track whether you're joining

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,369
us from your couch kitchen or hammock we

29
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,380
hope you're safe and ready to kick web

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,380
dev live into gear now we'll be coming

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
to you in different time zones each day

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,159
reaching you no matter where you are on

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,930
the globe will be bringing you content

34
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,119
from across our teams as well as members

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,200
from their web community at large now

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
each day you'll have Googlers on standby

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,430
to answer your questions in real-time so

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,750
as you're watching the session simply

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,420
head over to the live chat on web dev

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,210
slash live or on YouTube and just ask

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,570
away

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,780
now when coronavirus became global we

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,149
really felt the need to stabilize this

44
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,250
resulted in a spawning chrome releases

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,950
and temporarily rolling back the same

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,229
site cookie changes now we wanted to

47
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,750
track chrome usage and see what changed

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,579
to make sure that we could be on top of

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,189
any ecosystem changes - you probably

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,990
won't be surprised that we saw surges

51
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,619
and usage of meteor api's as video chat

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,259
and streaming really soared now also

53
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,690
some types of content so large traffic

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,740
surges

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,410
such as food commerce entertainment

56
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,370
health science etc and many developers

57
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,920
will focus in on making sure these sites

58
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,170
were as resilient as possible that's

59
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,120
when we gathered our best practices and

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,090
made them available on web dev slash

61
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,910
Kovac 19 we saw a lot of developers

62
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,590
scramble to make changes to their web

63
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,310
sites and many created new ones

64
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,600
governments had to jump on this to make

65
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,980
sure the people had all of the critical

66
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,410
information that was changing rapidly

67
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,720
I remember seeing Alex Russell tweet

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
about one of these government sites from

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,830
the state of California we were really

70
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,810
inspired with their work and wanted to

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,640
ask them about their experience and they

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,620
kindly agreed to join us so let's

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,140
welcome Aaron Hines the engineering tech

74
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,600
lead on the project thank you great to

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,550
be here so Aaron I'm really curious

76
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,680
about how this site even all came

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,560
together the alpha dot ca.gov team was

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,080
formed in December of 2019 by an

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,750
helicopter Arte to bring human centered

80
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,760
design processes to the state of

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,990
California and improve their online

82
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,810
services we built a lot of prototypes

83
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,030
for things like how to help people

84
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,250
review the safety of their tap water and

85
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,170
see if they're eligible for subsidized

86
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,360
phone services and to prepare for

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
wildfires and then when the pandemic at

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,530
the state were asked to stand up the

89
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,170
public response site Connie so when a

90
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,850
government team has to build something

91
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,160
like this like how do you go about it

92
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,200
what do you all call principals the

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,820
number one goal is to make something

94
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,850
that works well for everybody and the

95
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,890
technical considerations they're passing

96
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,660
accessibility audits making sure it

97
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,910
works with keyboard navigation with

98
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,340
screen readers and that it has a smooth

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,220
experience on low-end hardware we use

100
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,840
the cheapest phone which we get from the

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
local Cricket Wireless as our test

102
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,830
device and the non-technical

103
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,920
considerations are the readability

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,270
what's the grade level of all the

105
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,970
content and are we really building

106
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,860
something that users need and iterating

107
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,220
based on their feedback got it now I've

108
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,690
been trying to picture the time pressure

109
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,420
that you had to get this sight out he

110
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,739
tell us a little bit about how you

111
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,510
actually built the sign and how you

112
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,520
manage the trade-offs between quality

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,430
and that time line sure it's definitely

114
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,389
an accelerated time

115
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,520
and put the site up in four days then

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,599
the governor announced a statewide

117
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,509
lockdown and we had millions of visitors

118
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,129
really happy that we chose a static site

119
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,779
generator for that because it helped us

120
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,479
whether the traffic smoothly

121
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,279
we chose the Lebanese or the state

122
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,189
static site generator and we augment

123
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,629
that with web components and

124
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,930
surveillance API is built on nodejs got

125
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,849
it we're actually fans of eleventy too

126
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:53,310
we use it on web dev and really like it

127
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,560
was this kind of a new set up for the

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,629
team to build a web site like this or

129
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,889
have you been doing this for a while

130
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,169
I remember reading the article about how

131
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,060
web dev was built and being really happy

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,080
that we were using some of the same

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,710
tools we started using 11d at the end of

134
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,349
last year just to use it for a blog on

135
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,039
new Alfred on CA gov and when we used it

136
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,240
for the koban 19 site it's built on

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,199
content authored in the WordPress

138
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
environment and then we consume it with

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,219
the word best API and use github actions

140
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,680
for the eleventy production build got it

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,249
so you know now you've got the site out

142
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,659
there now I'm curious what's next fate

143
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,120
for you and the team next things for the

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,370
team are continuing to respond to the

145
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,259
pandemic we're going to be getting back

146
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,509
to helping improve other online services

147
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,969
and we're hiring check us out at news

148
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,830
dot alpha dot ca.gov if you want to help

149
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,500
out we're talking about eleven E and the

150
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,569
other tools that we're using I wanted to

151
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,189
mention that lighthouse is an incredibly

152
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,289
important tool for us because

153
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,180
performance is such a paramount concern

154
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,210
and I love the way that it came affiance

155
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,740
my development you can get the rest of

156
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,839
your teammates challenged each other and

157
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,129
say who can put up some more points

158
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,629
today we really need to get that score

159
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,300
up and I some I'm curious who who's

160
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,550
winning on the points race and I've been

161
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,589
really impressed and how you know you

162
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,300
think of like performance being a key

163
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,099
part of the accessibility story in

164
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,990
general Warren it's been really

165
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,969
inspiring to see the work that the U and

166
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,460
the team did here again at an incredibly

167
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,159
stressful time thank you so much for

168
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,750
coming on and sharing the story with us

169
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,879
thank you

170
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,110

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,930
like Aaron focus on accessibility

172
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,339
resilience and performance and we've

173
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,839
made some announcements over the last

174
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,610

that's great let's dive in first off

187
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,639
what our core web vitals they are a set

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,770
of user centric metrics and thresholds

189
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,229
that apply to all web pages across all

190
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,999
industry verticals and all types of

191
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,249
experiences on the web they are signals

192
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,959
to developers and business stakeholders

193
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,759
about the basic health of your site and

194
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,559
as such they should be measured by

195
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,899
everybody but okay I jumped straight

196
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,499
into definitions let's take a step back

197
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:26,179
why did we introduce core what vitals as

198
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,159
a thing there are already tons of

199
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,839
metrics lots of guidance about how to

200
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,249
measure your site's performance

201
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:35,869
how do core web vitals help us well

202
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,519
let's go back to our foundational goal

203
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,589
we want to create outlandishly

204
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,719
phenomenal experience for all of our

205
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,329
users and it's not just out of the

206
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,219
goodness of our hearts either we know

207
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,990
that every time we have a rage clicker

208
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,360
on our site we lose out on a reader a

209
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
customer or a client also we want a

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,409
money bug so there is this mythical

211
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,360
absolutely fabulous experience that

212
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,159
we've set our sights on creating it

213
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,199
seems easy until you realize that the

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,479
unicorn horn requires both loading and

215
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,099
interactivity performance measurement

216
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,689
and the rainbow well the rainbow

217
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,490
requires an entire rum setup for each

218
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,309
color so there you are watching your

219
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,759
flying unison unicorn dachshund and you

220
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,389
realize that you have this it's gorged

221
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,459
on a bit too much JavaScript it doesn't

222
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,469
respond when you're issuing it commands

223
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:27,379
and that's upsetting but it's going to

224
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,529
take quite a bit to get this to this so

225
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,639
the question is where do you start well

226
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,709
in order to know if you've improved we

227
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,870
need to know what to measure to know

228
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,279
what to measure we need to define our

229
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,219
goals so put another way what makes a

230
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,819
web experience shine this is where the

231
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,040
core dimensions of quality come in there

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,779
are foundational elements of a user

233
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:51,770
experience that make

234
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,280
and shine above the competition content

235
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,650
needs to load quickly we've all been

236
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:57,980
there

237
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,780
the longer we have to wait the more

238
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,390
likely we are to bail so your pages have

239
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,780
to load fast interactivity is just as

240
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,730
important you're clicking and nothing is

241
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,920
happening no fun you don't just need

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,810
content to be visible you need it to be

243
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,110
available for use lastly we want a page

244
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,360
to be stable and predictable just a few

245
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,250
pixels moving around can make a huge

246
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,890
difference these core dimensions of

247
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,990
quality reflect user centric signals

248
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,240
that have long been mission-critical for

249
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,460
you and your site's success so we are

250
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,040
closer to defining quality but how do we

251
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,600
measure these quality dimensions and

252
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,610
that's where representative metrics come

253
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,330
in to represent fast-loading we have

254
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,970
largest contentful paint or LCP it

255
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,310
provides insight into how quickly a user

256
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,960
is able to see the meat of what they are

257
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,810
expecting and wanting out of a page for

258
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,000
responsive interactivity we have first

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,610
input delay or fit this metric has been

260
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,590
a critical signal for developers for

261
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,050
some time to understand how long a page

262
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,270
takes to respond to a user's initial

263
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,690
input and finally to represent visual

264
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,730
stability we have cumulative layout

265
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,880
shift CLS CLS measures the amount that

266
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,100
the elements within the viewport move

267
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,130
around during load time ok so we know

268
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,450
how to measure our core quality

269
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,780
dimensions and let's say my LCP is three

270
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,930
seconds do I celebrate wait I don't

271
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,760
actually have any idea whether or not

272
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,250
that's good so I need to evaluate my

273
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,960
performance on a spectrum for each

274
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,620
metric which is where the final element

275
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,150
of Korowai vitals comes in our

276
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,670
thresholds for each representative

277
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,710
metric we have clear goal posts around

278
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,050
what constitutes a good experience one

279
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,580
that needs improvement and one that's

280
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,970
poor so for instance for LCP anything

281
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,550
that is 2.5 seconds or less is on its

282
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,890
way to being a unison anything between

283
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,380
2.5 and four seconds needs some work and

284
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,480
anything above four seconds is needing

285
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,870
quite a bit of love so to finish up our

286
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,910
definition of what our core web vitals

287
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,950
the initiative is a combination of three

288
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,440
things first is user centric quality

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,480
dimensions then we have represented

290
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,339
of metrics of those dimensions and

291
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,649
finally thresholds to help you evaluate

292
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,600
whether or not your performance is good

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,209
or not against any given metric but

294
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,800
there is one more piece of really

295
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,990
important information we need to know

296
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,690
how many page loads need to hit the

297
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,250
thresholds for the core web vitals

298
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,380
metrics to constitute a good experience

299
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,290
so say we have a hundred users if only

300
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,139
one of them has an LCP below 2.5 seconds

301
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,630
do I pass Korowai vitals the answer is

302
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,209
no core web vitals uses the 75th

303
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,730
percentile value of all pageviews in the

304
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,889
field to evaluate against the thresholds

305
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,339
in other words if at least 75% of page

306
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,740
views to a site meet the good threshold

307
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,079
the site is classified as having a good

308
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,940
performance for that metric and this

309
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,970
applies to all three metrics LCP FID and

310
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,060
CLS the 75th percentile is used to

311
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,430
evaluate all three core Web vitals is a

312
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,980
holistic package of everything you need

313
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,300
to create the foundation of a healthy

314
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,970
site they are valuable because they show

315
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,010
you exactly where to start to set

316
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,829
yourself up for success if 75% of your

317
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,199
users are getting fast interactive

318
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,519
stable content its cause for celebration

319
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,420
but as we know there are other

320
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,760
dimensions of quality that are extremely

321
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,060
important accessibility security mobile

322
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,920
friendliness there are a lot of

323
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,410
dimensions that make a basic unison even

324
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,660
more fabulous and are important to your

325
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,180
site's success so don't stop measuring

326
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,740
these if you already are and if you

327
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,720
aren't already

328
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,160
once you've optimized your core web

329
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,079
idols you can begin to venturing into

330
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,029
measuring and benchmarking against other

331
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,040
important vitals that are relevant to

332
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,470
your business and your users core Web

333
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,089
vitals are just as the name indicates

334
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,670
they are core and provide you with a

335
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,860
solid foundation upon which to further

336
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,889
optimize given how important it is to

337
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,899
quantify a user's experience accurately

338
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,510
in order to be successful on the web we

339
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,310
are constantly working to find ways to

340
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,589
better measure all quality dimensions

341
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:06,230
what this evolution has often meant in

342
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,269
the past is a stream of new metrics

343
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,519
tweaks to existing metrics and new

344
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,920
guidance many times at an unpredictable

345
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,500
cadence we know how difficult this can

346
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,269
be when trying to set goals aligned

347
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,269
roadmaps and good organizational

348
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,500
because of this we want to set a

349
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,449
predictable cadence of updates to Cora

350
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,910
vitals they will be refreshed once a

351
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,980
year around the time of Google i/o to

352
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,630
ensure that they reflect the latest in

353
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,250
our learnings and this includes

354
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,839
adjustments to the set of metrics as

355
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,300
well as the thresholds looking ahead

356
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,820
towards 2021 we will be providing

357
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,560
regular updates on future metric

358
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,149
candidates motivations and

359
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,550
implementation status okay so this is

360
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,899
all fine and good but how do I get

361
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,300
started to know whats optimized you have

362
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,630
to measure first and Korowai vitals are

363
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,310
now in all of your favorite developer

364
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,810
tools and there are more than what is

365
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,699
listed here including a new web vitals

366
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,529
library and a bunch of ecosystem tools

367
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,870
that have already adopted them as you

368
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,850
can see core web vitals are available

369
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,889
across the board you're able to measure

370
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,990
them for a specific page for your origin

371
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,449
locally in the lab and from real users

372
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,540
in the field remember that first input

373
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,940
delay is only measurable in the field so

374
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,949
you have to have a real user clicking on

375
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:17,570
your page in order to measure it but

376
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,100
that doesn't mean you can't use lab

377
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,139
tools to help you improve it total

378
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,079
blocking time TBT is a proxy lab metric

379
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
for FID that allows you to debug and

380
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,769
improve your interactivity in the lab

381
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,529
before you users ever have to experience

382
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,350
a bad vid the next obvious question is

383
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,149
again this is great but where do I start

384
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,149
what tool should I use I'm so glad you

385
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,519
asked each tool has its own strengths

386
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,560
for example psi is one of the only

387
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,269
places you can see your lab and field

388
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,339
data in one place and search console is

389
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:48,199
critical for identifying page types that

390
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,959
need improvement as I mentioned earlier

391
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,550
we're seeing so many great ecosystem

392
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,079
players and production monitoring

393
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,209
solutions already implementing support

394
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,860
for core what vitals and we're really

395
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,290
delighted but again you ask you've shown

396
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,120
me the magical unison and now you've

397
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,649
given me a pallet of tools to choose

398
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,079
from that's amazing but tell me what to

399
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,500
do first okay two things first go to

400
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,449
PageSpeed insights that will give you a

401
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,709
pulse of your core with vitals

402
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,600
performance in both the field and the

403
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,639
lab from crux you'll be able to see

404
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,709
whether or not 75% of your loads are

405
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,420
hitting the core with vitals thresholds

406
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,760
for both your page and your origin in

407
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,709
the field then you can take a look at

408
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,449
your lab data from lighthouse to see

409
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,740
whether or not you are hitting the core

410
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,510
web vitals thresholds for each metric in

411
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,610
a synthetic testing environment this

412
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,960
helps to guide you towards

413
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,610
noble opportunities to improve your

414
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,340
pages performance second check out some

415
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,200
more in-depth talks later today that go

416
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,790
into detail about measuring and

417
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,350
optimising against your core weigh

418
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,110
vitals and with that I'm gonna pass it

419
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,760
back to Dion thank you so much

420
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,560
great yeah thanks for showing us the

421
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,790
context and all of the information

422
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,620
across the whole slew of tools there

423
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,820
Elizabeth my pleasure

424
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,340
one of the critical steps in modern web

425
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,050
development with a lot of influence over

426
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,750
your vitals is your build step that's

427
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,550
where your CSS modules are turned into

428
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,100
real CSS your bundler analyzes your

429
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,410
module graph and optimizations can

430
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,170
really kick in we wanted to go deeper

431
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,030
here to understand the popular bundlers

432
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,370
how they work what they can and cannot

433
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,670
do and how to set them up for success

434
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,740
let's welcome Surma to tell us more hey

435
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,180
Surma

436
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,830
hey Dion so there are many best

437
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,570
practices to follow in web development

438
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,700
knowing them is one thing began in your

439
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,650
build system to follow them as well it's

440
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,510
kind of another beast so do you have

441
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,180
anything - maybe report on that front so

442
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,530
there's two bits on this side of things

443
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,000
on the one hand there are many

444
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
developers who want to know what build

445
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,480
tool they should learn and use for the

446
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,550
next project and on the other hand there

447
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,410
are many project that already have a

448
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,090
build tool set up but are looking to

449
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,730
improve their output to tackle both of

450
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,650
these problems we build tooling report

451
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,660
tooling report is a website that you can

452
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,690
actually go to right now tooling report

453
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,060
we create an extensive list of best

454
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,250
practices in web development took what

455
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,500
we think are the four most popular build

456
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,630
tools and checked for each build tool if

457
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,310
it allows you to follow that best

458
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,380
practice and each tool gets a point for

459
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,360
each test and it passes we chose to

460
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,890
start this project with browserify

461
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,430
parcel roll-up and web pack now browser

462
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,440
if I might be surprising to some but the

463
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,390
data indicates that there are still many

464
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,950
sites out there that use browserify

465
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,990
and we want to help those projects

466
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,660
improve their sites as well of course we

467
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,370
have been working with the core teams of

468
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,709
all these tools to make sure that we're

469
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,900
not only used a tool correctly but also

470
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,360
represent them fairly the tests are

471
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,100
subdivided into categories and in the

472
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,690
overview you can get a quick sense of

473
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,970
which tool is excelling at what category

474
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,860
you can get more information on the

475
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,570
tests in the overview and learn more

476
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,730
about it and now this is where I think

477
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,710
tooling report gets really interests

478
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,470
each test has a dedicated page where you

479
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,750
can compare how the tool score on this

480
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,210
specific test there is an in-depth

481
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,100
explanation on why this test is

482
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,960
important and how it relates to best

483
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,090
practices and web development we also

484
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,549
explain how we codify the best practice

485
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,590
and what the expected outcome is and

486
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,929
finally at the bottom you can find an

487
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,419
explanation for each tool and writers

488
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,669
past or why it might have failed this

489
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,130
test if a tool is not passing a test we

490
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,049
will also link to back reports on the

491
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,940
tools issue tracker many of them we have

492
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,919
actually filed ourselves while building

493
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,679
tooling report we also link to a minimal

494
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,169
NPM project that we use to determine the

495
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,750
tools behavior this way tooling report

496
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,970
not only tells you what a tool can and

497
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,250
cannot do but you can also look at the

498
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,260
configuration files and plugins to see

499
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,419
how you can follow a best practice with

500
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,340
this tool this way the site double

501
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,860
functions as a source of documentation

502
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,779
the entire site is open source on github

503
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,520
and we'd love the community to help us

504
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,529
come up with more tests and help us add

505
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,049
modules over time so you can check this

506
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,080
out now on tooling dot report thanks for

507
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,049
joining me soma Cheers now we're all

508
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,760
becoming more aware of the importance of

509
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,340
security and privacy chrome believes in

510
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,380
an open web that's respectful of users

511
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,630
privacy and maintains key use cases that

512
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,020
keeps the web working for everyone

513
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,909
I'd love to welcome Rowan to have a chat

514
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,559
and kind of share some of what's new

515
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,620
here hey there thanks Deon my name is

516
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,230
Ryan and I look after web dev rel for

517
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,110
security privacy payments and identity

518
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,980
or spy for now wow that's a cute

519
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,320
internal name we are part of the wider

520
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,169
trust and safety team with Ingram great

521
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,909
so why don't we start with same site

522
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,830
cookies and the temporary rollback that

523
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,720
that kind of kicked into gear for us

524
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,090
when kovat kind of really started to hit

525
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,039
globally can you kind of share whether

526
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,770
what the latest news is there sure yeah

527
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,720
so hopefully as a lot of you are aware

528
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,179
there's an update to the cookie standard

529
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,010
that's being adopted across Chrome

530
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,039
Firefox edge and others to restrict

531
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,350
cookies to first party by default

532
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,200
along with requiring explicitly marking

533
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,720
cookies for third party contexts now

534
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,820
that's all configured via the same site

535
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,390
attribute

536
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,420
hence same-side cookies we were rolling

537
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,460
this out to staple chrome but decided to

538
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,929
reverse this at the start of April

539
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,840
because the kovat situation saw a huge

540
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,660
jump in demand for online services but

541
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,940
also a huge shift in developers being at

542
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,010
home without their equipment or looking

543
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,320
after their families we made the call

544
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,240
that it was important to prioritize

545
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,299
stability at that moment now these

546
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,340
changes are intended to make the web a

547
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,920
safer place protecting against

548
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,080
cross-site request forgery and trying to

549
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,559
minimize the surface for covert tracking

550
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,780
sadly during a crisis when people are

551
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,970
most vulnerable you see these kind of

552
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,090
scams in the tax jump too so with the

553
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,520
Chrome 84 stable release which is

554
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,340
mid-july or about two weeks from now if

555
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,230
you're watching the stream we are gonna

556
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,660
start rolling this out again across all

557
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,059
chrome versions got it so what I'm

558
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,799
hearing here is that if you haven't

559
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,990
tested your site yet if you haven't made

560
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,730
changes to kind of make sure that

561
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,590
everything works well now is actually

562
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,500
the time to get going absolutely so we

563
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,390
have documentation in examples and

564
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,610
samples out there right now for same

565
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,860
site on web dev as well as on

566
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,919
chromium.org and we'll be covering

567
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,330
implementation and debugging in our

568
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,030
segment on day three okey doke so we all

569
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,950
love cookies but I'm assuming there's

570
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,900
going to be a few more things that we're

571
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,400
going to be talking about in the kind of

572
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,880
general view of trust and safety I'll be

573
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,799
honest with you I am gonna talk about

574
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,679
cookies a lot but the rest of the team

575
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,580
does have a healthier range of interests

576
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,410
okay sounds good so we're gonna cover

577
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,720
things like you know back in 2018

578
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,750
Specter kind of raised its head and we

579
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,940
as a web community started to really

580
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,820
look at what can we do to help make sure

581
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,410
that our users are secure are they gonna

582
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,000
be kind of those type of aspects that

583
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,580
we'll be covering two for sure yeah so

584
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,410
age is gonna be taking us through some

585
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,480
of the new cross-origin opener and

586
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,000
embedder policies or a coop and co-op

587
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,100
for short so like you were saying

588
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Specter was a vulnerability that in a

589
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,020
super short summary meant that malicious

590
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,179
code running in one browser process

591
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,190
might be able to read any data

592
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,740
associated with that process even if

593
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,270
it's from

594
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,260
in origin and that is super bad now one

595
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,540
of the mitigations for that is sight

596
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,180
isolation or putting each sight into a

597
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,460
separate process AG's going to be

598
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,050
running through how the headers allow

599
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,480
sites to opt into that along with a

600
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,070
bunch of other benefits that it brings

601
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,790
as well

602
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,410
got it got it got it okay so we've got

603
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,840
restricting cross-site cookies and then

604
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,790
we've got isolating sites to individual

605
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,380
processes we got this interest in

606
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,660
evolution so I'm sensing there's kind of

607
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,730
a bit of a theme here yeah there is

608
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,160
definitely a theme so we've also got

609
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
salmon mod on the team and they're gonna

610
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,910
kick off our little segment to explain

611
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,640
the link between these and really comes

612
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,770
down to the Web today is seeing this

613
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,750
evolution of expectations regarding

614
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,840
privacy that includes users expecting

615
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,030
more transparency and control over their

616
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,890
online data and new regulations

617
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,080
impacting how data can be used and

618
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,990
collected now Google we believe in an

619
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,090
open web that's respectful of the users

620
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,490
privacy whilst also maintaining a

621
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,160
healthy ecosystem so under the banner of

622
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,620
the privacy sandbox we're introducing a

623
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,600
number of standards proposals that aim

624
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,120
to support the use cases that let people

625
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,190
make their living off creating web

626
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,800
content but do that in a way that better

627
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,530
respects user privacy we're also

628
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,300
actively seeking feedback on these

629
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,640
proposals we're participating in all the

630
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,010
open forums the w3c to discuss our

631
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,470
proposals as well as those submitted by

632
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,810
other parties to okay so the web's

633
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,430
evolving and we're getting new

634
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,010
privacy-preserving api's coming in and

635
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,350
we're getting rid of the old cross-site

636
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,390
data leaking API so they're kind of

637
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,780
moving out exactly and one of the ways I

638
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,340
like to think about it with our team as

639
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,860
well is that we're kind of all about the

640
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,950
places where you create relationships on

641
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,590
the web so people should feel in control

642
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,390
of their data when they browse around

643
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,730
the web with a clear choice about what

644
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,460
and where they share things and when

645
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,600
they do want to create a relationship

646
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,390
like signing in to a site or making a

647
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,940
purchase that should be simple secure

648
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,790
and only share what's needed awesome

649
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,350
thanks so much for the brain dump on

650
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,060
what we're thinking about here in the

651
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,530
realm of trust and safety row and I'm

652
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,600
really excited to see the content that's

653
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,950
coming later

654
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,930
on the stream from the team where we can

655
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,270
kind of go into more of a deep dive cool

656
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,240
thanks and I'll see you around now the

657
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,070
web has a great history as a Content

658
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,200
platform with its roots in hyperlinked

659
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,780
documents but digital content has gotten

660
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,060
richer and richer we think the web has a

661
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,850
great role to play here too I'd like to

662
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,440
invite Paul Backhouse to talk about a

663
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,000
new content type that we're really

664
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,040
excited about called web stories

665
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,610
hey Dion hey Paul so what are these web

666
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,530
stories and why are we working on them

667
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,240
my team and I have been hard at work

668
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,010
working on web stories and I'm very

669
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,300
excited to share some updates with you

670
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,370
and yes I'm talking about these kind of

671
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,440
stories you know fullscreen portray

672
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,920
tapped advanced swipe to move on and if

673
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,440
you like wait a second and you do late

674
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,510
to the show then you'd be right but

675
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,130
these are not your standup ward Garden

676
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,380
stories current implementations focus on

677
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,750
ephemerality and ultra low barrier to

678
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,850
creation but our bet is a destroys

679
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,800
format works beyond the ephemeral use

680
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,720
case and can become its own pillar in

681
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,880
the open web media landscape and that's

682
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,260
because they're really cheaper to make

683
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,150
them video and more engaging in a text

684
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,310
article and really important web stories

685
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,810
are different to ward off stories in

686
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,700
many important ways just like a regular

687
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,680
web page you own them you host them and

688
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,330
very important you get the money from

689
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,840
the ads not the platform serving stories

690
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,920
because stories are really a visual

691
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,540
format my friends at Google search and

692
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,310
discover showcasing them in really cool

693
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,050
ways telling me that many more

694
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,490
integrations are coming later this year

695
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,590
we think this can be a great net new

696
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,780
traffic source for web creators these

697
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,670
stories look visually really compelling

698
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,590
but how hard is it actually to create

699
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,450
them if you want the web to be able to

700
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,010
compete with the closed platforms out

701
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,600
there story creation needs to be as

702
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,280
intuitive and fast for all content

703
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,620
creators now lots of people are working

704
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,900
on making web stores a thing but one of

705
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,340
the things my own team is doing is

706
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,350
bringing story creation to WordPress the

707
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,780
most used CMS in the world in the form

708
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,400
of a visual editor coming to you very

709
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,880
soon kind of more about the beta at goog

710
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,160
le slash story editor you'll hopefully

711
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,200
see all the basic editing features you

712
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,210
would expect like smooth image and B

713
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,460
you're handling text controls shape

714
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,190
masking and so on but we're also working

715
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,050
on some you might not expect like this

716
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,790
one we call text magic running in real

717
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,470
time against images from the unsplash

718
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,920
api here target on this feature make

719
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,170
so that the editor always ensures Texas

720
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,240
readable making dynamic decisions about

721
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,950
the background line height and so on I

722
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,290
hope you like it as much as I do yeah it

723
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,030
looks really cool you know I can't wait

724
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,770
to read some of these stories on the web

725
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,140
thanks so much for for sharing their

726
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,820
pool and and thanks again to Paul and
