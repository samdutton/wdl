4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,179
hi everyone thanks for watching this

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,130
session on debugging JavaScript SEO

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,539
issues in the next 15 minutes I will

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,550
take you on a short journey in which we

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,320
will talk a bit about the various that a

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,689
few SEO still have about JavaScript and

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,480
Google search then look at the tools

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,450
available to SEO and developers and then

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,370
get our hands dirty on a few case

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,410
studies from the real world now let's

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,180
get started with looking at the basics

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,960
can SEO and JavaScript be friends

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
there's a bunch of history behind this

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,739
that contributed to various opinions and

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,920
answers to this question today the

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,550
answer is generally yes sure as with

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,260
every technology there are things that

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,680
can go wrong but there's nothing

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,930
inherently or categorically wrong with

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,439
JavaScript sites in Google search let's

24
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,360
look at a few things people tend to get

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,150
wrong about javascript and search the

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,310
number one concern brought up is that

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,560
Googlebot does not support modern

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,990
JavaScript or has otherwise very limited

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,210
capabilities in terms of JavaScript

30
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,659
features at Google IO 2019 we announced

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,840
the Evergreen Googlebot this means that

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,659
Googlebot uses a current stable Chrome

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,640
to render websites and execute

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,850
JavaScript and that Googlebot follows

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,130
the release of new chrome versions quite

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,720
closely another worry is concerned with

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,479
the two waves of indexing and the delay

38
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,720
between crawling and rendering Googlebot

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,229
renders all pages and the two waves were

40
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,240
a simplification of the process that

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
isn't accurate anymore the time pages

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,159
spent in the queue between crawling and

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,399
rendering is very very short five

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,460
seconds at the median a few minutes for

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,340
the 90th percentile rendering itself

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,800
well takes as long as it takes your

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,890
website to load in the browser

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,099
last but not least be wary of blanket

49
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,230
statements that paint JavaScript as the

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,110
general SEO issue well some search

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,879
engines might still have limited

52
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,060
capabilities for processing JavaScript

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,680
they ultimately want to understand

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,170
modern websites and that includes

55
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,629
JavaScript if javascript is used

56
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,049
responsibly tested properly and

57
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:39,730
implemented correctly then there are no

58
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,230
issues for google search in particular

59
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,129
and solutions exist for SEO in general

60
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,349
for example you may consider server-side

61
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,420
rendering or use dynamic rendering as a

62
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,090
workaround further crawlers when saying

63
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,209
test your site properly the follow up

64
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,909
question is usually well how do I test

65
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,030
my site properly and luckily we have a

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,459
whole toolkit for you to test your site

67
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,400
for Google search let's take a look at

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
what's available

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,189
the first tool in your tool belt is

70
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,470
Google search console it's a super

71
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,120
powerful tool for your Google search

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,150
performance besides a ton of reports it

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,699
contains the gyro inspection tool that

74
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,560
lets you check if the URL is in Google

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,709
search if there are any issues and how

76
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,569
Googlebot sees the page the second tool

77
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,790
that is really helpful is the rich

78
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,780
results tests it takes any URL or lets

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,709
you copy and paste code to check its

80
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,870
main purpose is to show a structured

81
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,940
data is correctly implemented but it has

82
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,799
much more to offer than just that

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,510
the last but not least the

84
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,430
mobile-friendly test is similar to the

85
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,069
rich results test on top of the rendered

86
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,989
HTML the status of all embedded

87
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,959
resources and network requests it also

88
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,519
shows an above the full screen shot of

89
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,849
the page as well as possible mobile user

90
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,239
experience issues now let's take these

91
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,000
tools for spin I have built three

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,250
websites based on real cases that ID

93
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,010
bugged in the webmaster forums the first

94
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,440
case is a single page application that

95
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,760
does not show up and will at all as I'm

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,370
not the owner of the domain I don't have

97
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,110
access to Google search console for this

98
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,409
side but I can still take a look I will

99
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:27,400
start with a mobile

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,710
detests to get a first look at the page

101
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,650
in question as we can see the page loads

102
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,130
but shows an error message when I load

103
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,470
the page in the browser it displays the

104
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,009
data correctly hmm we can take a look at

105
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,870
the resources Googlebot tried to load

106
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,340
for this page here we see that one

107
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,850
wasn't loaded the API Dahl example.org

108
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,120
slash products URL wasn't loaded because

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,850
it's blocked by robots.txt when

110
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,710
Googlebot renders it respects the

111
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,990
robots.txt for each network request it

112
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,800
needs to make the HTML CSS JavaScript

113
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,220
images or API calls in this case someone

114
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,139
prevented Googlebot from making the API

115
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,470
call by disallowing it in robots.txt in

116
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,960
this case the web app handles a failed

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
API request as a not found error and

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,070
shows a corresponding message to the

119
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,570
user

120
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,360
we caught this as a software for and as

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,320
it is a narrow page we didn't index it

122
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,270
take note that there are safer ways to

123
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,160
show a 404 page in a single page app

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,370
such as redirecting to a URL with a four

125
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,680
for status or setting the page to no

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,580
index right we solved that one that's

127
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,510
pretty good all right on to the next one

128
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,610
this one is described as a progressive

129
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,550
web app or PWA that didn't show up in

130
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,400
search except for their home page let's

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,639
go find out why looking at the home page

132
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,580
it looks alright the other views in this

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,970
progressive web app also know just fine

134
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,090
hmm

135
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,909
let's test one of these pages we will

136
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,590
use the mobile-friendly test again to

137
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,159
get a first look at what's going on oh

138
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,949
the test says it can't access the page

139
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,979
but it worked in the browser so let's

140
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,699
check with our dev tools in the network

141
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,449
tab I see that I get a 200 status from

142
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,419
the service worker though what happens

143
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,130
when I open the page in an incognito

144
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,080
window whoops so

145
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,939
or the server isn't actually properly

146
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,430
set up to display the page instead the

147
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,169
serviceworker does all the work to

148
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,349
handle the navigation that isn't good

149
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:51,969
Googlebot has to behave like a

150
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,099
first-time visitor so it loads a page

151
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,289
without the serviceworker cookies and so

152
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,960
on this needs to be fixed on the server

153
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
great two websites fixed but I have one

154
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,389
more to go this one is a news website

155
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,759
that is worried because not all content

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,849
can be found by a Google search to mix

157
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,979
things up a little bit I'll use the rich

158
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,099
results test for this one the website

159
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,400
doesn't seem to have any obvious issues

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,020
let's look at the rendered HTML hmm even

161
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,310
that looks fine to me

162
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,229
so let's take a look at the web site in

163
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,270
the browser so it loads 10 news stories

164
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,060
and links to each news story and then

165
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,940
loads more stories as I scroll down do

166
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,800
we find that in the rendered HTML -

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,419
interesting this story isn't in the

168
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,520
rendered HTML it looks like the initial

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,830
10 stories are there but none of the

170
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,529
content that is being loaded on scroll

171
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,690
wait does it work when I resize the

172
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,669
window

173
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:56,740
oops it only works when the user Scrolls

174
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,289
well Google but doesn't scroll that's

175
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,199
why these stories are loaded that's not

176
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,449
exactly a problem this can be solved by

177
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,949
using an intersection observer for

178
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,830
instance generally I recommend checking

179
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,969
out the documentation at

180
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,759
developers.google.com slash search for

181
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,919
much more information on this topic and

182
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,580
other topics I hope this was interesting

183
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,259
and helped you with testing your

184
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,659
websites for Google search keep building

185
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,030
cool stuff on the web and take care

186
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,520
[Music]
