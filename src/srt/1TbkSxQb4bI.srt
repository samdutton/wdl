1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,620
Are you fed up with console spam?

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,210
Sick of browser messages that tell you problems but

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,710
not how to fix them?

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,130
Well, the Issues tab is a new way for Chrome

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,800
DevTools to help you find and fix problems with your web

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,010
site. Problems detected by the browser are

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,010
presented in a structured format, separate

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,010
from the console.

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,810
And that also means your own console messages don't get

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,430
drowned out by browser warnings.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,270
The Issues tab aggregates different types of problems.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,110
It describes problems using clear and simple language,

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,110
explains how to fix them, and links to affected resources

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,490
within DevTools.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,120
And shows you where to find further guidance.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,540
So let's run through that from start to finish.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,960
First, you need a page with problems.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,330
Well, for this example, we have a page with lots of

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,330
problems.

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,460
Open the page in Chrome and then open Chrome DevTools.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,670
As you can see, issues were detected.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,550
Click the 'go to issues' button in the yellow warning bar.

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,020
You can also select the Issues tab from the 'More Tools'

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,850
menu or click on the blue icon at the

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
top of DevTools.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,150
Now you might need to click the 'reload page' button

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,610
since DevTools can't collect requests while it's closed.

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,650
You'll notice that for the moment, warnings that used to

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,660
show up in the console still do as well as in the

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Issues tab.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,740
The initial version of the Issues tab checks for three

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,870
types of issue: cookie problems, mixed content,

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,920
cross-origin embedder policy - that's COEP - issues

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,130
as well. Future versions will support more

35
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,130
issue types.

36
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,470
So click an item in the Issues tab and you'll see that

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,550
each item has four components.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,970
A headline, describing the issue, a description

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,980
providing the context and the solution, and

40
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,600
an 'affected resources' section that links to the resources

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,560
within the appropriate DevTools contexts such as the

42
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,990
Network panel, and also links to further guidance.

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,320
Click on items within affected resources to view details.

44
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,700
In this example, there is one cookie and one request.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,870
Now the Issues tab explains problems

46
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,210
and tells you how to fix them.

47
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,960
But it can also show your resources in the appropriate

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,460
context within the DevTools themselves.

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,130
So click on a resource link to view the item in context.

50
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,170
In this example, click samesite-sandbox.glitch.me

51
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,510
to show the cookies attached to that request.

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,890
Scroll to view the item with a problem; in this case, the

53
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,890
cookie ck02.

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,480
Hover over the Information icon on the right to see the

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,940
problem and how to fix it.

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,690
You can also go the other way. Right-click on an item

57
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,780
within DevTools to show issues associated with

58
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,660
it. We'll be adding more features to the Issues tab in the

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,990
future. So let us know what you think, how we could improve

60
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,830
the Issues tab and what features you'd like to see.

61
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,540
You can comment on this video or file bug reports in

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,630
Crbug, which is the engineering team's bug tracker,

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,500
or send a tweet to @ChromeDevTools.

64
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,130
As ever, we really appreciate your feedback.
