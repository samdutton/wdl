00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,130
[Applause]

00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,570
[Music]

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,010
hello rim thank you for joining us today

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,200
my name is sebastian benz I'm part of

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,420
the amp developer relations team and my

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,070
name is Nana rising honey and I'm a

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,040
product manager on the amp project we

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,390
want to talk about the work we are doing

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,090
on amp to make better women less painful

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,849
and developers more productive yeah I'm

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,529
incredibly excited so let's dive right

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,530
into it so now we would be remiss if we

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,690
talked about em and didn't talk about

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,460
the impact of Google's recent

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,410
announcement around the page experience

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,770
ranking signal absolutely so even before

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,629
we can actually start talking about amp

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,730
and page experience first let's just

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,730
talk about what the announcement is in

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,620
May the Google search team announced

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,789
that they're going to measure how the

23
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,829
page is experienced by the user in

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,660
addition to price signals such as a

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,000
pages usefulness and this whole suite of

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
X measurements is called page experience

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,670
it uses core web vitals which the chrome

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,530
team announced earlier that month and

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,630
adds other pre-existing signals such as

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,700
mobile friendliness safe browsing and

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,940
HTTPS on top of it and the great thing

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,069
is that these metrics line up really

33
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,200
well with amps design goals of making

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,270
sure that users are getting a content

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,490
forward experience on a rig and are able

36
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,319
to consume content without having to

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,750
download unnecessary resources or wait

38
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,720
for unnecessary processing okay so how

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,869
does amp do against page experience good

40
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,209
catch actually we did some analysis and

41
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,860
we saw that a majority of amp pages

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,229
actually already do pretty well against

43
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,690
this criteria this means that amp is

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,550
really living up to the intention of

45
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,440
being a well lit path to creating a

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,869
great page experience so you said that a

47
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,360
majority of amp pages meet the criteria

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,489
but not all yep

49
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,830
so in the cases where the amp page

50
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,509
doesn't perform well against the page

51
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,640
experience criteria we saw that they

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,410
failed for reasons that were outside of

53
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,319
amps control such as overly large images

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,330
being served on mobile devices or the

55
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,179
server response time being too slow

56
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,619
that's a really interesting key aspect

57
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,440
of page experience that the core web

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,510
battles are mash up from real user data

59
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,480
this means to improve your cover battles

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,130
for example it's a good idea to use a

61
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,460
CDN to ensure that users

62
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,960
the world get your conduct delivered

63
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,600
quickly yeah and just like other

64
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,640
libraries and frameworks the amp project

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,770
will be monitoring these metrics closely

66
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,780
and continue investing in amps

67
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,970
performance by our performance working

68
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,220
group but more generally it's really

69
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,350
important to note that amp will intends

70
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,450
to reduce the ongoing effort needed to

71
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,610
create pages that offer a great user

72
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,010
experience and we intend to do so by

73
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,050
helping offload tasks and worries such

74
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,600
as browser compatibility accessibility

75
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,570
javascript budgets etc at its core and

76
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,330
as a UI component library before using

77
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,250
amp often struggled with too much choice

78
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,870
when it came to adding a new feature to

79
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,060
a site having to decide whether I should

80
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,130
bid my own carousel which is a bad idea

81
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,440
or finding a suitable existing

82
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,660
implementation could take a lot of time

83
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,690
and energy with amp you get a flexible

84
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,300
high quality or high component out of

85
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,160
the box and you can be sure that these

86
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,710
perform well are accessible and play

87
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,410
along well with each other recently I

88
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,150
talked to a developer from an agency

89
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,130
which uses am for building most of their

90
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,770
clients websites they told me that one

91
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,690
of their two side in terms had been able

92
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,730
to build a fully interactive website

93
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,070
from one of their clients without any

94
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,020
JavaScript knowledge I think that's

95
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,030
fantastic and a great example for the

96
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,610
value of a good UI component library it

97
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,020
makes it easy to get started for

98
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,090
beginners and then also experienced

99
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,520
developers to focus on creating new user

100
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
experiences instead of bike sharing

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,890
technical details and that's exactly

102
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,650
what we're focusing on in 2020 we want

103
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,810
amp to be a cost-effective and simple

104
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,880
solution that allows developers to focus

105
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,980
on their product and not worry about

106
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,350
other things like performance

107
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,600
infrastructure etc and this is an effort

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,090
that we're calling amp as a service the

109
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,120
idea here is to use em as a turnkey

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,460
solution to easily create and then

111
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,560
maintain a great page experience and

112
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,600
make developers more productive

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,270
simultaneously so what exactly do you

114
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,580
intend to do so the first thing that we

115
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,870
really want to do is address the

116
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,550
feedback that app developers have and

117
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,110
some of the top complaints that we've

118
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,150
seen with amp is first the need for

119
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,460
custom JavaScript and second the fact

120
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,500
that the inline CSS limit is too small

121
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,610
at 50 kilobytes

122
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,409
now we address the need for

123
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,419
javascript by adding amp script a

124
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:40,519
component that allows you to add custom

125
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,559
JavaScript to amp to help fulfill any

126
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,509
business specific need that amp doesn't

127
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,729
solve and if you want to hear more here

128
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,379
you should stay tuned because our

129
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,300
colleagues Ben Morse and crystal Lambert

130
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,589
will be talking you through this in

131
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,659
their talk titled where Christ GS

132
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,300
now with our CSS limit the intention was

133
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,729
to promote CSS hygiene but we got

134
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,649
feedback that the limit was too tight at

135
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,779
50 kilobytes so we worked with the amp

136
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,309
community to understand what a

137
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,619
reasonable CSS limit could be and after

138
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,629
working with plugin developers news

139
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,669
publishers and e-commerce site creators

140
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,709
we realized that most interactive

141
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,689
experiences could actually fit me within

142
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,569
75 kilobytes of CSS and so that's what

143
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:20,149
we made our new limit 75 kilobytes and

144
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,249
this really seems to have hit the sweet

145
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:24,499
spot with a vibe to kill my limit I have

146
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:25,969
from many developers that they've been

147
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:27,769
strongly was keeping this yes as below

148
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,779
the limit but I still have to hear from

149
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,759
someone starting with the 75 Caleb

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,369
element yeah fingers crossed that this

151
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,739
limit works now aside from addressing

152
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,749
feedback we wanted to we want to make

153
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,729
developers more productive we want to

154
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:41,899
help them create and maintain

155
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,179
performance sites as well the problem

156
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,550
usually wasn't with Ambit self but then

157
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,619
they had to maintain two versions of the

158
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,990
pages the canonical one and an

159
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,349
additional one and one yep that's far

160
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,659
that's by far the largest problem that

161
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,179
amp developers have the problem is even

162
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,129
more acute if you have separate teams

163
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,899
that are working on the amp and mobile

164
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,029
web experience especially if they're in

165
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,639
separate parts of the organization to be

166
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,159
honest the amp team itself advocated for

167
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,779
paired amp experiences when we got

168
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,360
started we saw it as an easy way to

169
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,339
create amp pages with the least amount

170
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,949
of effort but talking to developers over

171
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,139
time has made us realise the amount of

172
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,969
pain that can be associated with

173
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:25,399
maintaining this dual code base and that

174
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,259
this outweighs the initial games of

175
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,879
actually creating the amp page quickly

176
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,399
and Google's page experience

177
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,199
announcement is a great move for amp

178
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
developers in this regard it allows

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,219
development teams to really think about

180
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,959
how they want to continue investing in

181
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,139
amp going forward ok so say I'm I'm

182
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,029
publishing paired-end pages because I

183
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,349
want to be in the Google top stories

184
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,569
accountable should I continue doing this

185
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,220
so in that case I would ask for you

186
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,350
consider the maintenance costs that you

187
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,060
are incurring by having to maintain an

188
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,620
amp version of your code and a non

189
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,990
immersion of your code now that you have

190
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,880
the option to be flexible with your tech

191
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,590
stack you should be looking to pick a

192
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,450
setup that allows all your web

193
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,370
developers to be productive from day one

194
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,560
so you're telling those we're going the

195
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,990
paired-end route to completely drop and

196
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,990
support know what we're telling them is

197
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,400
to pick something that makes them the

198
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,140
most productive and this could be a

199
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,390
number of things developers could pick

200
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,040
experiences on their site that could

201
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,930
actually benefit from amp and only

202
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,180
invest in amp for those experiences or

203
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,730
they could go fully am first across all

204
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,620
their site if they actually believe that

205
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,360
amp is able to meet their needs and

206
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,430
we've gotten pretty positive feedback

207
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,140
from developers who use amp as their

208
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,180
main library because they think that amp

209
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,460
makes them more productive and this is

210
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,980
what we see amps future as a component

211
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,930
library that helps developers be more

212
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,850
productive and this is why we're

213
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,710
investing in allowing everyone to use

214
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,690
amp components even outside of amp pages

215
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,790
it's an effort that we're calling bento

216
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,770
app and we look forward to releasing it

217
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,770
later this year I'm really excited about

218
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,680
this focusing on amp as your I component

219
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,690
library isn't much healthier direction

220
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,090
in my opinion and I'm very happy that

221
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,669
we're making this move another we were

222
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,590
taking or learnings from and/or making

223
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,729
them available to provide your audience

224
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,570
our server side optimizations fan pages

225
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,430
at the beginning amp pages we're mostly

226
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,979
short from our caches and these perform

227
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,020
additional optimizations enabling

228
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,500
amstrong user experience however many

229
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,180
developers started using and forbidding

230
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,940
their whole website in these cases and

231
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,919
pages are not stopped from a cache and

232
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,229
there has been room for improving amps

233
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,440
loading performance to address this we

234
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,909
created app optimizer

235
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,339
a tool to bring em cache optimizations

236
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,860
to publishers for example we use an

237
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,260
optimized for the official app website

238
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,660
after death and by using I'm optimizing

239
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,120
achieves the same performance as when

240
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,730
the page is served from an app cache and

241
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,920
what I really like and optimizer fits

242
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,200
really well into your idea of a bizarre

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,839
service it enables us to automate bet

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,480
development best practices for example

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
the latest of optimizer with these added

246
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,440
support for image source a generation to

247
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,130
make it easier to serve optimized images

248
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,620
another example is JavaScript modules

249
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,230
the amp project is soon going to start

250
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,180
serving them run to them of components

251
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,730
as JavaScript modules and if you're

252
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,530
using amp optimizer you will

253
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,480
automatically get the benefit of smaller

254
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,490
runtime modules once this becomes

255
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,970
available and that sounds so great and

256
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,260
I'm really excited about all the

257
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,370
improvements that are coming to

258
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,650
optimizer but what's the best way for

259
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,360
developers to actually include amp

260
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,140
optimizer

261
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,760
I mean of course you could include it

262
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,950
normally in your build pipeline or your

263
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,740
rendering pipeline but ideally you

264
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,780
shouldn't have to think about how to do

265
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,480
get M optimizer our goal is to make the

266
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,430
integration seamless by integrating an

267
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,180
optimizer

268
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,950
into existing frameworks and single

269
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,260
sensors the next is integration is a

270
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,600
great example for what a good ahmedabad

271
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,570
experience can look like next is has a

272
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,670
special amp mode that you enable your

273
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,010
flag and this will result in the

274
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,070
generated page being ballot app the cool

275
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,020
thing is that you can start using amp

276
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,120
component straight out of the box and

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,589
you don't need to worry about the EM

278
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,630
boilerplate or importing M components

279
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,180
all of this is automatically added in

280
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,709
the background band optimizer

281
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,230
which is integrated directly into next

282
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,020
earnest and the resulting editing

283
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,360
experience was really nice and it feels

284
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,310
like that development from 30 years ago

285
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,330
and a great example for this is as Axios

286
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,700
they recently launched the new site and

287
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,580
it's completely built on am using these

288
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,050
days and they've been really happy with

289
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,280
the experience another example for a CMS

290
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,290
that has these features integrated is

291
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,930
WordPress recently the official and

292
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,970
breakfast plug-in start the publishing

293
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,480
optimized amp by default so this means

294
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,490
if you built an amp age using WordPress

295
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,850
you get the best serving performance for

296
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,760
Wow it's it's really exciting to see so

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,110
many new experiences that are being

298
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,790
built using amp and in fact amp

299
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,830
optimizer and I'm really hoping to see

300
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,980
more but that's it that's our time and

301
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,589
that's our vision for 2020 the Google

302
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,329
Page experience announcement allows amp

303
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,070
to focus on what it does best

304
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,230
be a UI component library that helps

305
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,480
developers be more productive by helping

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
them deploy web development best

307
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,130
practices at scale and if you want to
