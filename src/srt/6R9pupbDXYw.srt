00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,849
hi I'm Damian a well because he's thing

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,550
consultant at Google in this talk you

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,810
will learn how to define an install

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,550
strategy across all your mobile

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,250
experiences letting your users install

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,380
your app is one of the best ways to keep

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,230
them engaged today you can achieve that

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,779
in different ways let's start with

12
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,149
native app installs if you have a native

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,710
application you might think that this

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,930
might be the best platform to promote to

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,930
all your users and for some of them this

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,840
might be true but for some users native

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,060
apps can have some disadvantages too

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,460
the most common one is storage

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,070
constraints making space for a new app

20
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,490
may mean removing valuable content

21
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,380
freeing up storage is also the number

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,690
one reason users remove apps from their

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,020
devices there's also the issue of

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,809
available bandwidth especially for users

25
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,149
on slow connections and expensive data

26
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:11,110
plans finally moving to a store creates

27
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,329
additional friction and delays a user

28
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,189
action that could be performed directly

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:18,009
in the web a great alternative to this

30
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,109
is allowing users to install your

31
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,060
progress he web app from the browser

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,549
through another home screen prompt you

33
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,530
can also upload your PWA to the play

34
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,350
store using trusted web activity in this

35
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,840
example came to under a real estate

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,509
company from Brazil was able to reuse

37
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,780
the same codebase in the world and the

38
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,670
Play Store while offering a great

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,429
experience to users let's take a look at

40
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:45,189
another example all your rooms is one of

41
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,929
the largest hospitality companies in

42
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,060
India they have a very large user base

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,459
coming from a variety of devices and

44
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,859
networks they have built different

45
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,170
versions of their mobile experience to

46
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,529
satisfy the needs of all their users

47
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:01,209
first I created a native application for

48
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,920
the Play Store for the most

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,109
sophisticated users this could be the

50
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,569
best choice all you light is a

51
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,819
progressive web app uploaded to Play

52
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,190
Store be a trusted web activity it

53
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,930
provides the same functionality of the

54
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,170
nav bar well occupying only 7% of the

55
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,080
space finally for users that visit the

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,420
site directly by typing the URL or

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,239
clicking on a link or offers the chance

58
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,560
of installing the pedo

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,290
directly from the home screen having all

60
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,080
these ways to achieve app installs is

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,020
great but how can you combine all these

62
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,510
offerings to increase installation rates

63
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,970
well I Bodi make your apps compete with

64
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,160
each other let's discuss some strategies

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,130
to combine different install offerings

66
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,420
the first strategy is to show the

67
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,340
different options in the same screen

68
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,739
this is a simple approach that might

69
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,410
just work for many users the challenge

70
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,569
is to be able to communicate the value

71
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,060
proposition to distinguish clearly one

72
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,310
from the other but instead of delegating

73
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,860
the choice completely to users we can

74
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,680
make the life easier the idea of the

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,510
following strategies is to make some

76
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,049
inferences for example by tracking users

77
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:14,530
behavior and device characteristics we

78
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,280
call this heuristic based approaches the

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,650
first one is web installed as fallback

80
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,319
in this strategy you can start showing

81
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,569
the native app installed prompt if the

82
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,940
user doesn't install the app and keeps

83
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,280
visiting to your website chances are

84
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,250
that the web is their platform of choice

85
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,540
after a while you can start promoting

86
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,480
your pillow EA to these users this

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,600
strategy can be implemented very easily

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
for example by using cookies to drag

89
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,489
user behavior the group of users that

90
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,140
this means the abun huh

91
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,880
keep coming several times to the side

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,040
might be good candidates for a web

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,470
install offering but before showing the

94
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,989
web install call-to-action there are two

95
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,170
more things to take into account the

96
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,209
first one make sure that the user hasn't

97
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,489
already installed your native app or

98
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,880
your PDA by other means the Getty store

99
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,380
related apps API can help you check that

100
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,420
the second is actually a UX best

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,810
practice to maximize the opt-in rate for

102
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,000
your web install prompts you might want

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,030
to use the double permission pattern in

104
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,120
this example shows AG web install icon

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,700
after capturing the before installed

106
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,130
prompt event when the user clicks on it

107
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,229
they trigger the standard Add to Home

108
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,389
screen prompt if you want to learn about

109
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,789
UX patterns for web permissions like

110
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,129
this one check

111
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,860
Deshea stock safe permissions for the

112
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,669
capable web at crontab Sammy 2019 let's

113
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,610
move now to the second strategy

114
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,349
intuitively users on slow networks or

115
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,659
low-end devices might be more inclined

116
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,099
to download light apps

117
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,279
therefore if it's possible to identify a

118
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,129
user's device one could prioritize the

119
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,949
light up over the heavier native app

120
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,259
installed version you can implement this

121
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,539
by writing a function checking for

122
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,729
device characteristics to decide which

123
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,189
prompt to show if it's a low-end device

124
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,580
a light up if it's a high-end device you

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,919
can offer the core native app inside the

126
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,080
function the by signals can be obtained

127
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,779
in two ways the first one is by using

128
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,509
javascript api s-- like device memory

129
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,059
hard work on currency or the network

130
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,639
information API the second one is by

131
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,189
using client hints which can be inferred

132
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,009
from the header of the HTTP request to

133
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,229
use them you need to send an asset CH

134
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,449
gathering your response indicating the

135
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,550
type of hints you want to receive for

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,369
example device memory after that you

137
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:46,289
will start receiving these hints in the

138
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,679
header of the HCP request finally you

139
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,899
can use this information to map to a

140
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,329
device category and use that later to

141
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,939
decide which prompt to show if you want

142
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,439
to learn techniques on how to map the

143
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,689
buy signals to device categories

144
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,389
check out adaptive loading a talk that

145
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,569
was given at random Sammy 2019 prepping

146
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,219
us today you can offer different

147
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,229
channels to users to install your model

148
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,719
experiences for example you could offer

149
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,689
an ad but ap delay available in the Play

150
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,029
Store and iWeb installed from the user

151
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,699
screen then you can define a heuristic

152
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,740
to show the most suitable install

153
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,050
offering to a particular user you can

154
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,149
create a very simple one based on the

155
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:29,459
user behavior on your site for example

156
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,829
by tracking how often they come to it or

157
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:32,759
you can go for a more sophisticated

158
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,149
approach when mapping the buy signals to

159
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,679
device categories and show different

160
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,019
install offerings depending if the

161
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,559
device is low mid or high end we

162
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,089
encourage you to experiment with these

163
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,759
techniques for example by running a be

164
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,159
test and to reach out to us on Twitter

165
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,010
to share your experiences

166
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,020
I hope you continue enjoying what the

167
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,510
