00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello and welcome to "Security and Privacy for the Open

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,080
Web". I'm Maud, and I'm a Developer Advocate for the Chrome

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,500
team recording from Berlin.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,170
And I am Sam.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,840
Coming to you live-ish from Tooting Bec

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,210
in South London.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,380
OK. First, Sam, let's travel in time a

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,220
bit and understand what the "open web" means because the

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,220
web is open by definition, right?

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,680
Yeah. Well, I mean, sort of.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,140
The web was originally designed to be open and

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,060
transparent. In fact, Tim Berners-Lee envisaged

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,150
the web as a kind of read/write medium.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,400
You know, the browser would be an editor as much as a

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
reader.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,410
And right from the early days, the limited scope of what

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,490
browsers could do helped keep them safe for,

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,040
you know, anonymous, stateless document rendering.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,290
But then capabilities and expectations

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,040
grew. And, you know, we wanted to log-in and then

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,460
e-commerce and so on.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,170
And then we got phishing, malware, man-in-the-middle

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,340
attacks and all the rest.

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,720
Yeah. So in response, you know, we've had

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,140
browser sandboxing, ubiquitous HTTPS,

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,350
protections against malicious sites, plugin deprecation,

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,980
and all that stuff, which is great.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,740
However, some of the web technologies designed

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,860
decades ago aren't being used in the simple

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,860
way that was intended.

31
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,830
You know, it was difficult in the 1990s to envisage how

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,620
user agent strings and cookies would

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,620
be used beyond their intended capabilities

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
in the 2020s.

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,750
And this evolution in how some web

36
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,760
technologies are able to be utilized, paired

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,760
with the rising expectations from users to

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,220
have more control and transparency over their personal

39
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,020
data, has led the whole web ecosystem

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,060
to evaluate longstanding practices.

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,900
And now, more than ever, I think the web needs privacy

42
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,070
and security by default for all users.

43
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,990
I think we'll see an increasingly high proportion of people

44
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,200
on the web who've never used a browser before

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,200
or who are simply outside their normal browsing

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,290
habits. People may be looking for information

47
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,630
who may be in a crisis or just feeling vulnerable.

48
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,840
And I actually think these are the hardest, most complex

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,470
and most important problems to solve on the

50
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,470
web right now.

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,140
But of course, this is not easy.

52
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,810
Even in terms of user interface design.

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,730
For example, how do you make quite complex concepts,

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,690
such as cookie management, understandable

55
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,230
for billions of users?

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,110
Yes. So that's why users need transparency and control

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,280
in their browsers.

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,910
And it's not just browser features, right.

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,990
Web standards and defaults also need to change.

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,740
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,870
I mean, cookies, for example, and data such as

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,000
user agent strings that can be used for device

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,340
fingerprinting and to covertly track individual

64
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,300
users.

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,510
Also features such as the referrer header that

66
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,800
can reveal private browsing data.

67
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,390
As developers, we need to rethink the way we handle user

68
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,980
data. Do you really need all the data you access?

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,650
And is it clear to your users what you're doing with their

70
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,600
data?

71
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,900
Yeah, because like as a developer, you're actually best

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,860
placed to understand potential problems

73
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,280
and help fix them.

74
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,370
So, OK, let's run through today's sessions.

75
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,490
We'll be talking about security, privacy,

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,040
payments, and identity.

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,790
Yeah. First up, our colleague Rowan Merewood has

78
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,500
some recipes to help you manage your cookies,

79
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,920
whether or not you've heard about SameSite and changes to

80
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,170
cookie defaults.

81
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,430
If you're using any kind of third party content,

82
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,680
such as ads or you're doing anything

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,810
with cookies on your site, you should definitely check

84
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,810
out his session.

85
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,350
Second, thinking about the cross-origin web, you need

86
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,860
to prevent information leaks.

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,570
And that's where powerful protections like the COOP and

88
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,730
COEP policy headers come in.

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,030
To understand how this can protect your website, check out

90
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,700
the great session from our colleague Eiji Kitamura.

91
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,410
OK. So that's all nice.

92
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,290
But how do you actually debug that stuff?

93
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,620
Like SameSite cookies and COOP and COEP?

94
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,500
Well, the new Issues tab in Chrome

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,000
DevTools is there to help you.

96
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,800
The Issues tab makes it much easier to find and

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,050
fix problems instead of console message

98
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,260
clutter you get clear instructions

99
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,720
on how to fix problems.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,730
So with this sessions, you'll learn techniques to not

101
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,650
passively leak your users' data.

102
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,650
And there's a pattern here.

103
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,030
Debugging is important, but how can you and your team

104
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,820
develop a mindset around privacy and security

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,740
and prepare for the future?

106
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,580
Rowan and I thought about this and put together strategies

107
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,200
with concrete examples of web APIs and HTTP headers

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,580
you surely know, to help you make sure you're using

109
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
just the data you need.

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,250
And speaking of user data, a crucial entry point

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
for this is the ubiquitous sign-in

112
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,550
form. And this is particularly important right now

113
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,930
when lots of sites need to be accessible to new

114
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,970
users.

115
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,810
Now, in my session, I'll show you how to use cross-platform

116
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,690
browser features to build a simple email/password

117
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,400
log in form that's secure, accessible,

118
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,780
and easy to use.

119
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,070
Just like the sign-in experience, you need payment

120
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,950
flows to be clear and safe.

121
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,370
So what's new in web payments?

122
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,040
Eiji Kitamura will guide you through this.

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,960
So if your website uses payments, make sure to check this

124
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,170
session out.

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,340
Okay, so that's it for the sessions.

126
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,510
But we'd also like to tell you about one really important

127
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,680
initiative that we're all involved with, the Privacy

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Sandbox.

129
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,760
Now, more than ever, people need to know that private

130
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,060
data stays private.

131
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,930
On the other hand, people want to do stuff on the web

132
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,640
that's private and personal.

133
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,860
You know, you want to go shopping, use your bank online,

134
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,860
communicate private information and so on.

135
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,610
And keeping data safe can't just be

136
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,200
about constraints. We can't just say no to everything.

137
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,200
The problem is keeping your users safe is not just about

138
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,370
getting your own house in order.

139
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,080
It's not just about first-party interactions because

140
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,130
most web sites use services from other companies

141
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,130
to provide analytics or videos and do lots

142
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,420
of other useful stuff.

143
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,590
Most notably, ads are included in webpages via

144
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,100
third-party JavaScript and iframes.

145
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,060
And ad views, clicks, and conversions are measured

146
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,140
via third-party cookies and scripts.

147
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,650
But when you visit a website, you may not be aware of these

148
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,070
third parties and what they're doing with your data.

149
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,530
And actually, publishers and web developers themselves may

150
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,820
not have visibility on the entire third-party supply chain.

151
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,200
Ad targeting, conversion measurement, and other use cases

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,250
currently rely on stable cross-site identity.

153
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,380
Historically, this has been done with third-party cookies.

154
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,790
But today, browsers have begun to restrict access

155
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
to these.

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,510
Other mechanisms for cross-site user tracking are also

157
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,470
being used, such as covert browser storage, device

158
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,430
fingerprinting, and requests for personal information like

159
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,680
email addresses.

160
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,140
And this is a dilemma for the web.

161
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,900
How can legitimate third-party use

162
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,400
cases be supported without enabling users

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,940
to be tracked across sites.

164
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,610
In particular, how can websites fund content

165
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,200
by enabling third parties to show ads and measure ad

166
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,910
performance, but not allow individual users

167
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,950
to be profiled?

168
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,580
How can advertisers and site owners evaluate a user's

169
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,130
authenticity without resorting to dark patterns

170
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,250
such as device fingerprinting?

171
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,130
Well, this is where the Privacy Sandbox comes in.

172
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,840
And just to avoid confusion, this is not the

173
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,100
same as the browser sandbox architecture

174
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,680
you may have heard of though it does build on some

175
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,600
of the same ideas of keeping your data safe.

176
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,650
The Privacy Sandbox is a set of proposals to implement

177
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,730
privacy-preserving APIs to support business

178
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,160
models that fund websites in the absence

179
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,780
of mechanisms like third-party cookies.

180
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
Now the Privacy Sandbox supports five core

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,000
use cases for a world without third-party cookies:

182
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,000
measurement for ads and other third party content,

183
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,920
relevance features for advertising, fraud detection

184
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,180
distinguishing real humans from bots and spammers,

185
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,010
getting rid of covert tracking, and finally,

186
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,180
secure and simple identity management across

187
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,310
sites. So we need browsers to support

188
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,690
third party use cases in a future without cookies.

189
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,320
But whatever happens, users

190
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,490
need cookie security and choice right now.

191
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,870
So how did the Privacy Sandbox proposal satisfy third

192
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,990
party use cases?

193
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,250
So I'm not going to go into the gory details of every

194
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,870
single one of the Privacy Sandbox proposals here.

195
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,290
Shameless self promotion, but you really should

196
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,960
read our article "Digging into the Privacy Sandbox",

197
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,800
which outlines all the proposals.

198
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,340
But you know what we really need though is feedback

199
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,600
on the proposals.

200
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,470
In particular, to suggest missing use cases

201
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,690
and more private ways to accomplish their goals.

202
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,560
The Chrome team is responding to feedback on the proposals

203
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,230
on GitHub and in W3C forums.

204
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,700
And we really hope you'll join the discussion.

205
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,120
And this is especially true if you work for a publisher,

206
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,990
advertiser, or an ad tech company.

207
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,580
And if you have other questions, feedback, or ideas to

208
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,500
share on today's sessions, ping us on Twitter @ChromiumDev

209
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,630
with the hashtag #webdevlive.

210
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,210
Yeah. Thanks, Maud. And if you want to get in touch, we'll

211
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,470
be online to answer questions in the live chat

212
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,590
during the web.dev LIVE event.

213
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,260
Or you can just add a comment to this video.

214
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,930
So thanks for watching.

215
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,770
So let's get on with this.
