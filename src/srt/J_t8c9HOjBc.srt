00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,199
hi everyone thanks for joining I'm PJ

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,449
I'm a product manager on the chrome web

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,830
platform team responsible for

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,500
progressive web apps notifications and

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,539
permissions today's talk is about

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,369
quieter notification permission prompts

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,769
and how recent changes to how chrome

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,170
handles notification permission requests

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,899
can make browsing for the web a little

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,940
better for everyone

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,200
there's also important information in

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,430
here for developers who use

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,950
notifications to help you improve your

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,230
user experience improve your

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,510
notification accept rates and to tell

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,489
you about upcoming changes that will

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,250
detect and flag abuse abuse of

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,149
notification prompts or content if

22
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,680
you're not familiar with them web

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,480
notifications are channel for

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,129
communicating timely and contextually

25
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,920
relevant information to the user mostly

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,270
these work just like push notifications

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,180
in mobile apps except they can also work

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,060
on desktop on Windows Mac as well as

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,689
smartphones on Android for example web

30
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,130
notifications appear in the notification

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,200
drawer and on desktop

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,670
they typically appear in the top right

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,189
corner of the screen in some cases

34
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,860
notifications aren't just helpful they

35
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,570
are almost essential to the apps

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,299
functionality for example if you had an

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,950
incoming call from a communication app

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,950
like google google duo or chat that's

39
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,880
not something you want to know about

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,350
later you need to know about it right

41
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,860
away of course not everyone uses apps

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,040
that require notifications and not all

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,570
websites are putting the needs of their

44
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,640
users first and that means that we are

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,810
seeing a lot of websites out there that

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,210
are misusing notifications in ways that

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,180
are annoying or could be abusive before

48
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,009
we get into that though I want to talk

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,630
about how users get enrolled in

50
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,509
notifications to receive web

51
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,090
notifications a user needs to accept a

52
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,299
notification permission requests when

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,640
websites prompt users out of context for

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,039
a notification such as when a user first

55
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,259
arrives on the web site it can be a

56
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,510
pretty annoying distraction both from

57
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,590
the browsing experience it's

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,160
as well as from the website's content

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,860
worse some abusive websites look for

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,780
ways to trick users into accepting

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,819
notifications that are then used to

62
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,400
promote malware or undesired content I

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,769
want to cover why we have notifications

64
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,090
in the web platform in the first place

65
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,430
in a little bit more depth the web

66
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,840
platform is there to enable web

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,459
developers to create powerful

68
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,010
applications and web notifications are

69
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,440
part of that toolkit without

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,480
notification support there would be

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
entire types of apps that would be

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,920
simply impossible to build using web

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,130
technology so for example messaging apps

74
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,440
calendars ecommerce for food delivery

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,140
notifiers taxi or ride-sharing apps all

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,780
dependent notifications to provide a

77
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,150
timely tap on the shoulder to the user

78
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,910
and well you can imagine that some of

79
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,200
these apps might be usable without

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,090
notifications you could see that most of

81
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,680
the time you're probably going to want

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,069
one we've also all equally experienced

83
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,690
some of the misuse of notifications

84
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,299
though that includes things like

85
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,090
unwanted marketing promotions or content

86
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,530
that just isn't very important or

87
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,989
relevant to us at a given moment to

88
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,579
address this problem starting in Chrome

89
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,829
ad that was released in January of 2020

90
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,380
we started making changes to how these

91
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,480
notifications request work to help make

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,940
browsing the web safer and less

93
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,349
interruptive we're gonna get into that

94
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,739
new UI in the next slide in chrome 80 we

95
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,139
added quite notifications UI quite

96
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,810
notification UI is less interruptive but

97
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,940
it still lets the users know that the

98
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,069
request has been made there's a little

99
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,200
bit of animation to catch the eye but on

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,750
desktop the dialogue is in the omnibox

101
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,030
so it doesn't actually cover any part of

102
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,160
the web content on mobile the

103
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,780
notification prompt used to be a modal

104
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,810
in normal UI but in quiet UI it's an

105
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,819
easily dismissed info bar at the bottom

106
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,459
of the screen quite notification UI aims

107
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,260
to reduce the visual priority and

108
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,150
interruptive 'no sub mode vacation

109
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,030
requests on desktop what you're seeing

110
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,829
in this example on the left you'll

111
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,599
notice the bell icon initially animates

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,760
with text indicating that notifications

113
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,820
are blocked on the site in mobile the

114
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,400
quiet UI is now an info bar in both of

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,130
these cases in product help explains to

116
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,160
the user

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
why notifications were blocked on the

118
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,620
site quite notifications UI was created

119
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,390
specifically to address the concerns I

120
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,390
mentioned earlier in this talk we

121
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,740
received frequent complaints from users

122
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,870
in chrome feedback about disruptive

123
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,480
notification permission prompts or

124
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,940
unwanted notifications that being said

125
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,160
there are services with tens or hundreds

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,440
of millions of users like messaging apps

127
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,840
and calendars that are depending on

128
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,970
timely web notifications every single

129
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,640
day let's talk for a moment about how

130
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,770
users get enrolled in quiet notification

131
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,840
UI there's several ways that this can

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,750
happen first users could just enroll

133
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,390
themselves manually by changing their

134
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,590
preferences in Chrome settings second

135
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,970
sites that have very low accept rates

136
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,950
for notification permission requests

137
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,170
will be automatically enrolled in quiet

138
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,600
notifications UI and this is currently

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,850
sites that have the lowest few

140
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,400
percentile of notification accept rates

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,980
so the absolute rate needed for quite

142
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,380
notification UI does change over time

143
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,660
because we are using percentiles we'll

144
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,250
also periodically increase the accept

145
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,290
pre percentile that's needed to preserve

146
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,950
normal notification UI we always keep a

147
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,050
control group of users that are in

148
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,540
normal notification permission UI so

149
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,930
that if a site's accept rates improve we

150
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,760
can remove it from quiet UI and

151
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,180
enforcement third there are some users

152
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,010
who almost never accept any notification

153
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,930
permission requests these users simply

154
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,240
don't want notifications and for these

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,100
users we adaptively enable quite

156
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,230
notification mode on their behalf in

157
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,570
Chrome settings if they repeatedly block

158
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,690
notification requests as sites improve

159
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,940
their behavior and use of notification

160
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,130
permission requests we expect that there

161
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,630
will be fewer and fewer users who are

162
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,480
adaptively placed in quiet notification

163
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,890
UI mode finally and this is starting in

164
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,830
chrome 84 which is coming up soon we're

165
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,360
going to begin enforcing against abusive

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,580
notification prompts the try to mislead

167
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,500
users are fishing for private

168
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,140
information or promoting malware in this

169
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,150
case in addition to quite notifications

170
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,940
UI the user is going to be advised in

171
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,650
the notification prompt that the site

172
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,200
may be trying to trick them so

173
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,730
what should you do to make sure your

174
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,840
website is not enrolled in quite

175
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,270
notification UI well first and foremost

176
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,680
if your prompting users to enroll

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,570
notifications as soon as they arrive on

178
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,060
your website please stop doing that this

179
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,410
is the easiest way to improve your

180
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,930
notification accept rate very few users

181
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,430
will accept a notification from a site

182
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,380
they're visiting for the first time and

183
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,020
if you think about it why would they

184
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,910
we're all experiencing information

185
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,250
overload wait until you know your user

186
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,470
better and you know you can add value

187
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,470
for your user before you prompt them you

188
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,510
can and should prompt your user to

189
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,880
accept notification when there's a clear

190
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,920
user benefit and in the context of the

191
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,190
user's journey in your application

192
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,240
websites that ask for notification

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
permission in the context where the

194
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,540
benefit is clear the user have 80%

195
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,880
accept rates or higher that should be

196
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,010
your goal even if you do the best

197
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,510
possible job with your notification

198
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,060
prompt to UX it's possible that some of

199
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,400
your users may be in quiet notification

200
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
UI mode so the first thing you want to

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,450
check here is to make sure that the

202
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,730
accept rates on your site or what you

203
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,430
really expect them to be notification

204
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,770
accept rate data is in the chrome user

205
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,480
experience report which is a public

206
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,890
database containing important

207
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,080
information about real-world chrome

208
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,540
metrics for popular destinations on the

209
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,060
web there's a minimum number of users

210
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,430
and decisions that are required for data

211
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,110
to be available and the chrome user

212
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,210
experience report and that's to help

213
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,850
with preserving visitor privacy so if

214
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,410
your site doesn't have data and the

215
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,330
chrome user experience report you may

216
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,040
need to get that information from

217
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,820
somewhere else

218
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,670
for example most notifications service

219
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,490
providers will have this instrumented so

220
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,770
that you can check your accept rates or

221
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,900
if you've rolled your own notifications

222
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,610
implementation you may need to add your

223
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,880
own instrumentation it's also a good

224
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,380
idea to look at the notification accept

225
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,780
rates of sites that are like yours in

226
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,580
the chrome user experience report so you

227
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,990
can get a sense for what the benchmark

228
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,300
accept rates are and aim to be better

229
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,540
than those the article linked here in

230
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,400
the slide will give you more details

231
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,810
about how to use the chrome user

232
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,760
experience data set to learn more about

233
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
users notification permission prompt

234
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,100
decisions on your website so the second

235
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,140
thing you need to think about is how can

236
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,550
you make your notification requests

237
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,910
boring

238
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,710
context I know I mentioned this before

239
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,780
but it bears repeating you want to make

240
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,250
absolutely sure that you're asking for

241
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,560
notification permission at a moment in

242
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,210
the users journey that makes sense to

243
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,220
them in this example we're showing a

244
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,780
notification request the first time the

245
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,180
user receives a response to their first

246
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,240
chat this is a perfect moment even with

247
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,890
quiet notification UI it should be

248
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,960
obvious to the user why they would want

249
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,750
to accept notifications the activity and

250
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,850
motion in the web app combined with the

251
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,890
motion of the browser prompt should be

252
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,480
sufficient cues for the user to enroll

253
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,940
in notifications if they want them if

254
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,310
your user doesn't accept notifications

255
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,220
with this in context pattern there's a

256
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,450
pretty good chance that they just don't

257
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,310
want notifications and you should

258
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,220
respect that decision before I finish I

259
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,600
want to share a little bit about what's

260
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,300
coming next for notifications first

261
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,190
we're planning to increase the accept

262
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,440
rate percentile that's needed to have

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,170
normal notification prompts since this

264
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,730
is a percentile as well something to

265
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,470
keep in mind is that if other sites are

266
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,210
improving their notification UX and

267
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,910
you're not your site may be slipping

268
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,280
into a lower percentile and quite

269
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,990
notifications may be activated for your

270
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,970
site if your site is a notification

271
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,520
accept rate of over 50 percent you're in

272
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,860
safe territory but we recommend aiming

273
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,070
for 80 percent or better second chrome

274
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,140
places a high priority on user privacy

275
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,540
and security and we intend to take more

276
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,430
steps to protect users from abuse of

277
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,590
notification in the future that includes

278
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,020
more protections from usage notification

279
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,320
content as well as retroactive action to

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,180
help users who may have already enrolled

281
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,040
in notifications from abusive sites

282
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,490
prior to the release of chrome 84 most

283
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,200
important as we improve the

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
signal-to-noise ratio of the web

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,910
notification ecosystem we hope users

286
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,250
will come to view notifications as being

287
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,130
more helpful if this happens it means

288
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,930
we're doing a good job protecting users

289
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,970
from unwanted notification prompts an

290
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,090
unwanted notification content ultimately

291
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,590
this will help developers who use

292
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,300
notifications for key functionality in

293
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,340
their apps as users are more likely to

294
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,320
accept notifications when they have less

295
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,270
reason to be worried about spammy or

296
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,340
abusive notifications thanks again for

297
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,370
joining today everyone have a great day
