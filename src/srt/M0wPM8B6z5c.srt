00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,720
you

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,070
hi i'm andre today we're going to answer

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,890
some frequently features and

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,320
capabilities for installed pwas that

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,259
were reserved previously only to native

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,680
apps and to tell us more about what is

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,750
new and help us with some hard questions

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,930
we have a guest hi PJ tell us a tell us

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,309
about your role at Google

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,680
thanks so much Andrzej I'm PJ I'm a

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,180
product manager on the chrome web

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,370
platform team I work on progressive Web

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,370
Apps usually called pwace and basically

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,559
progressive web apps or modern

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,270
applications built using web

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,340
technologies that are making users

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,550
happier PWA is have a lot of

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,399
capabilities of which one is that they

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,809
can be installed into a user's computer

23
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,030
just the same as any other application

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,519
oh cool so that means we have exactly

25
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,360
the right person in the room for people

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,770
in the audience who are not yet familiar

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,360
with installable petaboys

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,580
can you tell us a bit more about what

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,210
they are and where they are available

30
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,950
being a savile is really a standout

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,470
feature for PW AAS because it's giving

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,759
web developers the ability to make

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,709
applications that can be started from

34
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,110
the Start menu on Windows from the

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,390
application folder on Mac the homescreen

36
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,509
on Android and iOS and these can really

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,220
look and feel like any other application

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,860
on the device so for applications that

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,989
users are using repeatedly being

40
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,539
installed means that that app is a

41
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,009
little bit more top-of-mind for the user

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,289
because that launching surface is is

43
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,270
immediately accessible to the user they

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,800
don't have to navigate anywhere in the

45
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,899
browser to get to get back to the

46
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,190
application it also means that the

47
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,929
application is showing up in the

48
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,209
activity switcher as a separate app and

49
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,429
that makes install quite attractive to

50
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,920
developers but I want to be clear that a

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,349
pw8 doesn't have to be installed to be a

52
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,289
PW a being installable is just one

53
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,470
property of a PW a us this question

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,720
about distribution so let's talk from

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,940
what about where PW A's are available

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,370
so first PW eyes can be installed

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,980
directly from the web browser on both

58
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,840
desktop and Android and on desktop pwace

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,819
can also be listed in the Windows Store

60
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,760
on Android you can find PW a powered

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,319
Android apps in the Play Store

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,719
these is a technology called a trusted

63
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,500
web activity

64
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,250
you also see pwace in the Samsung store

65
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,359
you might have heard that pwace are

66
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,950
showing up in the chroma West Play Store

67
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,750
and that's an early access feature I'm

68
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,180
really excited about so let's save a

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,290
little time at the end of the session to

70
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,560
talk more about that oh I'm really

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
looking forward to learning more about

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,269
Chrome OS Play Store but before that can

73
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,920
you tell us about the recent features

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,689
that you think are the most exciting for

75
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,060
developers I really wish that we had

76
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,650
time to go into everything that shipping

77
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,810
because there's a lot happening right

78
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,819
now but I'm gonna have to just pick a

79
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,430
few favorites for today so the features

80
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,069
that I'm most excited about are some of

81
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,209
the things that web developers could

82
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,519
previously only do using a hybrid

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,220
technology like an electron app or a

84
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,060
Cordova app and to begin here let me

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,919
just mention that the ability to install

86
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,109
pwace on desktop is still really new so

87
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,430
for those of you the audience who have

88
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,079
been paying close attention I might've

89
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,700
seen the announcement at i/o last year

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,530
this might seem like old news but I

91
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,760
think for a lot of the web development

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
community this is still a very new

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,569
feature and people are still getting

94
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,810
used to the super power that install can

95
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,359
happen everywhere you can now write one

96
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,609
app and have it be installable on

97
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,879
desktop on tablet on smartphones and

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,159
users can discover that app on your

99
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,129
website in search results in play in the

100
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,409
Windows Store in a Samsung store and

101
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,799
this is giving web developers a really

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,680
unprecedented reach for distribution of

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,620
their applications so I'm just super

104
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,479
excited that this is now possible for

105
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,359
they have install across all of these

106
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,650
different screens and through all of

107
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,629
these different channels the other

108
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,310
features that I'm most excited about are

109
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,319
all the capabilities that were

110
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,699
previously only possible with Cordova or

111
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,970
electron so for example registering a

112
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,669
file type handler for an app offering an

113
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,740
immersive mode so creating better web

114
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,409
games through an immersive mode and

115
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,080
adding context menus for shortcuts and

116
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,889
more so the file type handler would

117
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,740
allow a user to start a web-based image

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,229
editor by double clicking on an image in

119
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,330
their OS File Explorer

120
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,300
that's that's exciting exactly that and

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,819
so like with file type handling you can

122
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,620
register a file extension or mime type

123
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,479
so let's say that you've written a new

124
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,460
type of image editor and you can edit

125
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,550
jpg and pink files you could register a

126
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,009
file type extension for those file types

127
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,080
and then those files Heights will

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,909
automatically open and your editor if

129
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,979
the user double clicks on those a word

130
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,240
of warning file type handling isn't

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,699
quite here yet we expect it to go into

132
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,099
Oranje trial in chrome 85 in August and

133
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,159
to be available generally sometime in

134
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,710
the fall or winter looking forward for

135
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,229
this one to go stable tell me more about

136
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,280
the immersive mode what does that mean

137
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,690
immersive mode is a term that's just a

138
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,460
board from native it's a full-screen

139
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,280
mode and basically it removes all of the

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,319
operating system decorations so no

141
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,960
status bar no navigation bar and this is

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,440
great for games or other media basically

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,940
when you want to be able to address

144
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,449
every single pixel on the screen so I

145
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,550
could start a video player a full screen

146
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,740
from daikon and a home screen nice and

147
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,460
what about up short codes sure absolute

148
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,440
cuts are a way to provide quick access

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,750
to important functions in the app

150
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,349
directly from the app icon so for

151
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:03,120
example on Android you might be familiar

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
with a long press on the app icon on the

153
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,949
launch screen so or on the home screen

154
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,289
so if you were to long press on a home

155
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,150
screen icon for say a mail application

156
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,490
you might see compose functionality

157
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,759
directly in the menu that appears when

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,789
you long press on the mail client app

159
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,310
shortcuts also work on desktop operating

160
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,919
systems and that support will be

161
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,909
arriving in chrome 85 interesting so

162
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,830
that's like deep linking into parts off

163
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,110
might be the Blooey directly from the

164
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,840
icon that's on the home screen

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,690
exactly switching gears a little bit we

166
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,639
launched tracer to web activity at last

167
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,159
year's i/o and since then we have many

168
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,840
feature requests and questions from

169
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,879
developers and I wanted to go through

170
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,460
some of those with you today

171
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,139
first developers have pointed out that

172
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,120
the wait permissions work in the browser

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,129
any native is different

174
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,649
and that may stir users a little bit

175
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,979
confused as an example native apps gets

176
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,330
in the notification permission by

177
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,089
default while web apps need to need the

178
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,119
users to accept the permission first how

179
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,889
are how are we planning to solve those

180
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,309
inconsistencies so let's just start by

181
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,849
just sharing my perspective on the

182
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,639
philosophy here of I don't think that

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,949
users should need to think about what

184
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,839
technology was used to build the

185
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,199
application that they're using users

186
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,300
should really just have a job you know

187
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,249
users just have a job to get done and we

188
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:35,219
want to help developers help users as

189
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,889
easily as possible so wherever it makes

190
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,259
sense I think an installed web

191
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,330
application should use the operating

192
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,319
systems typical UI for things like

193
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
managing permissions launching and

194
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,969
switching between applications just to

195
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,669
match the users expectations for how

196
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,379
things should behave on the device that

197
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,229
they're using so we've introduced this

198
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,409
concept of notification delegation into

199
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,779
installed pwace and that means that when

200
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,300
a PW is installed it will delegate the

201
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,669
notification permission into the native

202
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,209
setting area on Android so another

203
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,369
difference between an app installed from

204
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,009
Play and a web for example is that an

205
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,899
app install from play automatically

206
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,719
receives notification permission so we

207
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,819
want that experience to be the same for

208
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,529
Android applications that were built

209
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:28,019
using a PWA and that's why we've

210
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,879
delegated the web notification

211
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,099
permission to the notification settings

212
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,130
panel in Android and these apps can be

213
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,659
configured to auto enroll users and

214
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,240
notifications so that they just look and

215
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,860
feel and behave exactly like any other

216
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,810
Android app and the user doesn't even

217
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,029
need to know that this application was

218
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,610
built using web technology in the future

219
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,860
we're going to be adding location to the

220
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,290
Settings panel to of course there won't

221
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,209
be any auto enrolment for location

222
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,319
because users are not Auto enrolled in

223
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,839
location before location permission on

224
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,569
in Android native apps either so we're

225
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,069
just gonna match what the behavior is

226
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:07,860
between you know for a native

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,449
application for apps that are installed

228
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,140
for

229
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,440
say the Play Store or from any other you

230
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,810
know distribution channel where the user

231
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,370
you know may or may not be aware that

232
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,010
this application is a web application

233
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,089
we're going to continue as well to

234
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,190
delegate more permissions and match OS

235
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,560
preferences over the next few releases

236
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,990
got it so this will make the experience

237
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,690
more seamless to users regardless of the

238
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,670
technology that developer used to build

239
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,240
app another frequent request developers

240
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,940
sometimes feel that when they make and

241
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,800
write an Android app using pdaboy and

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,899
treszura web activity they should have a

243
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,910
communication channel between the native

244
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,370
application and the web app this would

245
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,500
allow them to use native platform

246
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,720
capabilities where an equivalent on the

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,360
web doesn't exist already is this

248
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,089
something that is being considered I'm

249
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,230
really glad you asked this question

250
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,149
because this is exactly the kind of

251
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,970
product question that I really love and

252
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,440
I'd like to hear from our audience on

253
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,350
this one so today you can pass

254
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,480
parameters into a trusted with activity

255
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
when you launch it and you can use

256
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,790
intents to leave the trust of activity

257
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,160
and pass some information into another

258
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
activity inside of your app and we're

259
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,290
considering adding support for a message

260
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,720
bus for example we could extend post

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,899
message to enable a bus with this

262
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,209
functionality however I don't have use

263
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,519
cases from developers on exactly what

264
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,040
they need here most capabilities are

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,930
already in the web platform or are

266
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,320
planned in you know it herb plant as

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,630
part of the fugu effort to add web

268
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,990
capabilities to the web platform so if

269
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,459
the web platform has missing

270
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,339
capabilities I'd really rather add that

271
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,410
capability to the web then create a

272
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,290
message bus to native because if a

273
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,399
capability is part of the web platform

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,350
then it's gonna work everywhere and

275
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,149
developers only need to have one code

276
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,880
base which is simpler and that code base

277
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
will work in multiple browsers whether

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,070
the app is installed or not installed

279
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,190
etc so I'd like to turn this just to do

280
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,709
a question for our audience what do you

281
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,810
need to do in native code that you can't

282
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,260
do today in the web platform and other

283
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,670
things we could do to improve the web

284
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,829
platform so you wouldn't need to do that

285
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,030
in native

286
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,380
perhaps it's something that could only

287
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,360
be done in native and you really need

288
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,220
that message bus I'd really like to hear

289
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,620
from you about this cool I'm also

290
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,300
looking forward to hear from folks on

291
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,760
Twitter or if you're watching this live

292
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,300
on the live chat many developers have a

293
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,550
native application and prompting users

294
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,710
who install a PDA in the in the browser

295
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,360
when they already have the native app

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,660
installed can lead some confusion is

297
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,520
there a way to prevent the prompts from

298
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,560
showing when the native app is already

299
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,680
installed so that's a great question

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,570
it's also probably one of the the top

301
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,760
concerns that I hear from teams that are

302
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,650
implementing a progressive web app it's

303
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,360
it's called channel conflict and it

304
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,630
arises where you're not sure which

305
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,950
experience is going to be best for the

306
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,500
user so I think the most important thing

307
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,110
for developers to know is that you do

308
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,390
have full control over the promotion a

309
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,970
PW install so you know you don't need to

310
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,150
worry about the browser promoting your

311
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,920
PW a if you don't want it to there are

312
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,620
ways you can prevent the browser from

313
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,840
promoting the installation of your PW a

314
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,030
if for example you have a native app so

315
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,440
let's let's talk about how that works

316
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,130
first in the web app manifest there's a

317
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,330
couple of fields you should know about

318
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,250
one is called the related applications

319
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,510
field and this is where you can list

320
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,540
native apps for Android and iOS and then

321
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,100
there's another boolean field called

322
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,110
prefer related apps and if this is set

323
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,060
to true the browser's not going to

324
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,870
promote the install of your PW a

325
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,250
secondly there's an event that fires

326
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,530
when a PW a passes the install ability

327
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,930
check in the browser and when this

328
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,750
happens developers can call a prevent

329
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,060
default method and that's gonna block

330
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,880
any promotion of the PW a install in

331
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,970
browser UI finally there's a new

332
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,070
JavaScript API just landed earlier this

333
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,960
year called get installed related apps

334
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,690
and this is gonna let developers inspect

335
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,780
if the user has native apps installed on

336
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,700
the device that are associated with the

337
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,320
origin that the user is currently on and

338
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,660
just to be clear this isn't gonna let

339
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,490
you see any app that the user happens to

340
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,470
have installed in the device the app has

341
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,150
to be associated with the origin that

342
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,140
the user is on this API does allow for a

343
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,450
lot of programmatic flexibility for

344
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,490
developers so it means you

345
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,740
you have full control which experience

346
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,990
do you want to promote to the user you

347
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,350
could use for example user behavior you

348
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,270
could provide the user with preferences

349
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,270
in your HTML it's really up to you how

350
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,880
you want to use this control but it does

351
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,470
give you as the developer a lot of

352
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,690
control over what you promote to the

353
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,610
user and when it happens so this means I

354
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,350
can use this API to check my

355
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,390
notifications installed and make

356
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,430
decisions like showing that sounds crane

357
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,820
prompt or not what if my native app is

358
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,620
using trusted web activity willed is a

359
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,070
pee I use to return so yes absolutely

360
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,839
this does mean that you can use the API

361
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,450
to check your native app is installed at

362
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,250
Russell web activity is really just an

363
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,100
Android app so it will show up just like

364
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
any other Android app and to say this

365
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,709
API will return it it will also return

366
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,040
if the if the app is a it has been

367
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,720
installed from the web browser so a PWA

368
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,950
installed from the web browser will also

369
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,600
get returned by kit installed related

370
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,950
apps cool on the developer experiences

371
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,959
side we've been working on tools like

372
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,800
bubble wrap

373
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,870
to help developers view their project to

374
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,790
use interest of web activity but many

375
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,560
developers is you wonder if it wouldn't

376
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,390
be easier if you could just copy paste

377
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,459
in your own to the Play Store that's a

378
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,420
great question

379
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,950
so the reason why we've been focusing

380
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,320
our efforts on making this easier for

381
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,860
developers on bubble wrap is that we

382
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,740
could create a much more powerful much

383
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,630
more flexible system for developers for

384
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,579
building Android apps using a

385
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,709
command-line utility like bubble wrap

386
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,649
then what we could do in a web interface

387
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,140
so app stores are really a different

388
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,940
ecosystem and they have different

389
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,240
requirements and policies and we believe

390
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,130
that developers should have powerful

391
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,440
tools that they need to rethink the

392
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,360
experience of their applications for

393
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,399
this environment and we also want to

394
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,709
avoid giving developers the perception

395
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,120
that they could just drop a website into

396
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,470
the store without thinking about that

397
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,930
experience so there are all kinds of

398
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,430
design decisions that should go into

399
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,529
building an Android app whether or not

400
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,320
it's a PWA powering that up for example

401
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,610
you know what's the splash screen it'll

402
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,379
look like when you're gonna hide it when

403
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,439
to show content didi notifications there

404
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,489
wouldn't be that's this kind of

405
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,259
flexibility for configuring these

406
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,079
options with a web interface that being

407
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,789
said we wanted to be as easy as possible

408
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,549
so we've worked to streamline it to the

409
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,649
maximum extent that we can with bubble

410
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,489
wrap and make it a powerful but flexible

411
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:13,159
and easy-to-use developer tool what

412
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,159
about police or policies do Android apps

413
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,229
that use PW inside the tricity web

414
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,239
activity Stu needs to comply to those

415
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,039
policies I think you said the magic word

416
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,959
there which is Android app it doesn't

417
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,519
matter how your Android app is built

418
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,339
whether it's built using PWA s and web

419
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,959
technology or whether it's built using

420
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,109
Java or : play policies apply to all

421
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,789
Android apps distributed in the Play

422
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,949
Store and therefore they also apply to

423
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:39,199
Android apps built using progressive web

424
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,549
apps gotcha

425
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,759
so same same store policies apply what

426
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,769
about applications designed for children

427
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,199
can developers use web technology those

428
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:48,499
apps

429
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:51,079
if the target audience for your

430
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,329
application is children you need to

431
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,669
comply with the Play family policy

432
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:58,100
requirements and these requirements are

433
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,499
intended to help keep minors safe from

434
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,389
inappropriate content unfortunately

435
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,970
that's really difficult for the review

436
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,549
teams to evaluate with web apps where

437
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,220
the content can change and not only can

438
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,230
the first party content change but it's

439
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,909
really easy to include third party

440
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,230
content inside of a web application

441
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,779
which can be unintentionally

442
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,579
inappropriate let's imagine that you

443
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,589
were using you know an advertising

444
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,419
network or something else where you're

445
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,250
loading content in from a third party

446
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,659
site you might not be able to verify

447
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,149
yourself for sure whether or not that

448
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,559
content is always going to be

449
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,409
appropriate so for the time being it's

450
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:36,080
not possible to build Android apps using

451
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,330
trusted web activity that comply with

452
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,460
Play family policy we are working on

453
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,139
ways to make this possible in the future

454
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,899
got it so it seems PWAs are crossing

455
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,580
over ecosystems and developers need to

456
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,100
adjust some of their expectations from

457
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,919
that developers using trusted web

458
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,169
tivities are also expected to fulfill

459
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,509
your quality criteria is that wide that

460
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,169
criteria exists yeah nobody wants an app

461
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,730
store that's gonna be cluttered with

462
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,369
low-quality apps and we also want

463
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:05,149
developers to

464
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,649
succeed with their apps in the Play

465
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,119
Store keep in mind something that's

466
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,320
really different about distributing

467
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,289
through the Play Store than it is to you

468
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,059
know just sort of build a PWA on your

469
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,639
own site is that these apps have user

470
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,190
ratings and reviews and we want to make

471
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,570
sure that developers are set up for

472
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,359
success to get good ratings and reviews

473
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,869
on an aunt for their app so at a minimum

474
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,789
users expect apps that they install from

475
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,979
the Play Store to look and feel app like

476
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:34,129
to be fast to work offline and that's

477
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,379
why we have quality criteria for pwe

478
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,149
than in the App Store and this is

479
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,649
exactly what progressive web app

480
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,559
criteria has been intended to do from

481
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,929
the very beginning so first I want to

482
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,789
share that there are certain types of

483
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:47,899
events that can happen to a web

484
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,609
application that are effectively a crash

485
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,429
and these are things like you know a 404

486
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,129
happening these are things like failing

487
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,049
an offline check when the user goes

488
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,960
offline and returning to chromed I know

489
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,349
this is effectively a crash failing the

490
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,210
digital asset links verification which

491
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,499
is something you need to do with a

492
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:08,269
trusted web activity to verify that you

493
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,820
are the owner of the content and the

494
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,899
owner of the application in the app

495
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,089
store so if any of these things happen

496
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:17,960
starting in chrome 86 in October we are

497
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,059
going to be mapping those crashes into

498
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,940
Android vitals crash events and you will

499
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,700
see Android apps begin to crash if you

500
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,710
if users are running into 404s in your

501
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,299
application etc so that's just something

502
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,499
that developers should be aware of and

503
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,839
we're we're making another announcement

504
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,969
with more details about this the second

505
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,330
thing is on the performance side right

506
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,999
now don't have a date to announce with

507
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,919
respect to enforcement of enforce of

508
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,899
performance but developers should be

509
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:47,690
aware that the criteria is a full batch

510
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,479
PWA and a light has performance score of

511
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,830
80 or better and you can use

512
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,289
webpagetest.org slash easy or PageSpeed

513
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,690
insights against your start URL as the

514
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,580
fastest way to check whether or not

515
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,169
you're meeting this criteria because

516
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:03,080
having the app launched quickly is an

517
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,759
essential part of having a great

518
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,429
application experience for your users we

519
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,440
will be providing a lot of notice as to

520
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,359
when enforcement will begin it will be

521
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,059
in 2021 it won't be in 2020 for the

522
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,119
performance and full batch PWA scores so

523
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:17,740
Xbox

524
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,630
hear more about this later in the year

525
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,620
so less one tutor has recently launched

526
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,340
their pdaboy

527
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,679
on the chrome s Playstore which was

528
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,080
quite exciting can you tell us more

529
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,540
about how they did how they did it and

530
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,880
when it is this is becoming january

531
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,400
available i'm really excited about this

532
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,230
right now this is an early access

533
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,330
program and it requires manual

534
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,470
intervention from our team members so

535
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,880
it's not something that we can extend to

536
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,920
everyone in the community but we're

537
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,480
working on getting it to general

538
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,850
availability and when that rolls out

539
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,710
it'll be possible for everyone to just

540
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,900
do this themselves I'll give you a hint

541
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,790
it uses trusted web activity so if

542
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,020
you're building a great trusted web

543
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,559
activity

544
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,400
it'll be really easy to make your

545
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,809
progressive web app available in the

546
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,300
Chrome West Play Store in the future and

547
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,130
I hope we could share more about this in

548
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,770
the second half of the year so what are

549
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,330
soda web activities are coming to Chrome

550
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,870
OS nice well I think we covers a lot I

551
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,420
wish we had more time to discuss our

552
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,820
YouTube and though so for those of you

553
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,010
who are watching please do reach out to

554
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,120
