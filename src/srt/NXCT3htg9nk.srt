4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,960
back in March 2003 Nick Fink and Steve

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,880
champion stunned the web design world

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,619
with the concept of progressive

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,050
enhancement a strategy for web design

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,970
that emphasizes core web page content

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,369
first and that then progressively adds

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,560
more nuance and technically rigorous

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,750
layers of presentation and features on

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,510
top of the web content while in 2003

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,579
progressive enhancement was about using

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,510
at the time

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,700
modern CSS features unobtrusive

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,770
javascript or even scalable vector

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,870
graphics progressive enhancement and

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,270
20/20 is about using modern browser

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,789
capabilities my name is Thomas Tanner

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,070
I'm a developer advocate based out of

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,440
the Google Hamburg office today I want

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,149
to talk about progressively enhancing

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,640
like it's 2003 building for modern

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,010
browsers since we all can be here

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,570
together in person due to the

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,940
coronavirus I've converted my talk into

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,309
an online trip that I want to take you

28
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,500
on with me for this trip you need a

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,170
solid understanding of JavaScript

30
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,549
talking of JavaScript the browser

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,369
support for the latest quod JavaScript

32
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,490
features is great promises modules

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,130
classes template literals arrow

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,770
functions you name them all supported

35
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,680
basic functions work across the board in

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,080
all modern browsers and even super

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,299
recent language editions like optional

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,280
chaining and knowledge coalescing reach

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,650
support really quickly when it comes to

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,540
CRO JavaScript features the grass

41
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,520
couldn't be much greener than it is

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,710
today for the trick that we are going on

43
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,479
the likeness should have a good

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,979
understanding of progressive web apps

45
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,829
for this talk I work with a simple PWA

46
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,259
called fugu greetings the name of this

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,140
app is a hat tip to project fugu where

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,060
we work on giving the web all the powers

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,280
of native applications you can read more

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,899
about the project at web tour death

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,700
slash food - status

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,310
fugu breedings is drawing up that allows

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,869
you to create virtual greeting cards

54
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,390
just imagine you actually had traveled

55
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,220
to Google i/o and wanted to send a

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,830
greeting card to your loved ones let me

57
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,310
recall some of the pwe concepts

58
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,380
fool greetings is reliable and fully

59
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,540
offline enabled so even if you don't

60
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,730
have Network you can still use it it can

61
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,140
be installed to the home screen of the

62
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,420
device and it integrates seamlessly into

63
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,890
the operating system as a standalone

64
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,900
application with this out of the way

65
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,000
let's dive into the actual topic of this

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,030
talk progressive enhancement starting

67
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,739
each greeting card from scratch can be

68
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,750
really cumbersome so why not have a

69
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,819
feature that allows users to import an

70
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,890
image installed from there with a

71
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,840
traditional approach you have used an

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,910
input type file element to make this

73
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,319
happen first

74
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,450
you'd create the element set its ID and

75
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,730
the to be accepted mine types and then

76
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,340
programmatically click it and listen for

77
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,620
changes and it works perfectly fine the

78
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,630
image is imported straight onto the

79
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,060
canvas when there is an import feature

80
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,610
that probably should also be an export

81
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,830
feature so users can save their greeting

82
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,410
cards locally similar to before the

83
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,390
traditional way to saving files is to

84
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,860
create an anchor link with the download

85
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,080
attribute and with the blob URL as it's

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,970
a trove you would then programmatically

87
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,940
click it to trigger the download and to

88
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,290
prevent memory leaks from happening

89
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,420
hopefully make sure not to forget to

90
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,760
revoke the blob URL but wait a minute

91
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,100
mentally you haven't downloaded a

92
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,799
greeting card you have saved it rather

93
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,390
than showing you a safe dial-up that

94
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,829
lets you choose where to put the file

95
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,350
the browser instead has directly down on

96
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,239
the greeting card without interaction

97
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,920
and it's put it straight into your

98
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,670
downloads folder

99
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,640
this isn't good what if there were a

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,010
better way what if you could just open a

101
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,350
local file edit it and then save the

102
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,269
modifications either through a new file

103
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,579
or back to the original file that you

104
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,459
had initially opened turns out there is

105
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,560
a better way the native file system API

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,420
allows you to open a grade files and

107
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,819
directories make modifications and save

108
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,680
them back let's see how it can feature

109
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,530
detect if the API exists the native file

110
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,750
system API exposes a new method choose

111
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,750
file system entries I can use this to

112
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,530
conditionally load

113
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,859
import image MJS and export image MJS if

114
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:15,410
the API exists and if it isn't available

115
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,910
load the files with the legacy

116
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,340
approaches from the earlier slides but

117
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,720
before I dive into the native file

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,849
system API let me just quickly highlight

119
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,490
the progressive announcement pattern and

120
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,200
browsers that don't support

121
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,690
file system API hello the legacy scripts

122
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,030
you can see the network tabs of Firefox

123
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,990
and Safari here

124
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,660
however on Chrome only the new scripts

125
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,460
are loaded this is made elegantly

126
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,590
possible thanks to dynamic imports that

127
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,930
all modern browsers support as I said

128
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,030
earlier the grass is pretty green these

129
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,310
days let's look at the actual native

130
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,650
file system API based implementation for

131
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,380
importing an image I call window choose

132
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,300
file system entries and pass it an

133
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,670
accept option parameter where I say I

134
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,400
want image files both file extensions as

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,980
well as mime types are supported this

136
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,320
results in a file handle from the file

137
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,510
handle I can obtain the actual file by

138
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,030
calling its get file method exporting an

139
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,740
image is almost the same but this time

140
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,050
you need to pass a type parameter save

141
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,060
file to the choose file system entries

142
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,670
method so I get a file save dialog

143
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,490
before this wasn't necessary since Open

144
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,610
File is the default I said the accept

145
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,470
parameter similar as before but this

146
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,770
time limited to just PNG images again I

147
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,630
get back a financial but rather than

148
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,790
getting the file this time I'm creating

149
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,860
a writable stream by calling crate

150
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,770
writable next I read the blog which is

151
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,450
my greeting card image to the file

152
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,180
finally I close the writable screen

153
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,910
everything can always Fame the disc

154
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,830
could be Arg space there could be a

155
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,470
write or read arrow or maybe simply the

156
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,870
user cancels the file a lot this is why

157
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,060
I always read the calls in a try-catch

158
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,340
statement I can now open the file as

159
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,190
before the imported file is drawn right

160
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,350
onto the canvas I can make my edits and

161
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,840
finally save them with a real save

162
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,670
dialogue where I can choose the name and

163
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,370
storage location of the file now the

164
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,320
file is ready to be preserved for the

165
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,990
eternity about from storing files for

166
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,030
the eternity maybe I actually want to

167
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,430
share my greeting card this is something

168
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,710
that the web share and web share target

169
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,410
API is allow me to do mobile and more

170
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,270
recently also district operating systems

171
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,220
have gained native sharing mechanisms

172
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,920
for example here is safaris share sheet

173
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,560
on Mac OS triggered from an article on

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,220
my side block Tommy icon and click the

175
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,380
share button you can share a link to the

176
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,450
article with a friend for example by the

177
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,110
native messages

178
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,430
the code to make this happen is pretty

179
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,980
straightforward I call navigator dot

180
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,130
share and pass it an optional title text

181
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,310
and euro but what if I want to attach an

182
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,530
image whether one of the web share a P I

183
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,480
that you can see on the screen doesn't

184
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,430
support this yet the good news is that

185
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,560
web share level two has added file

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,540
sharing capabilities let me show you how

187
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,010
to make this work with a fool greeting

188
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,590
card application first I need to prepare

189
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,420
a data object with a files array

190
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,240
consisting of one blob and then a title

191
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,030
and a text next as a best practice and

192
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,920
the use of the new navigator dot can

193
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,660
share method but does what its name

194
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,180
suggests it tells me if the data object

195
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm trying to share can't technically be

196
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,710
shared by the browser if navigator can

197
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,030
share tells me the data can be shared

198
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,880
and in the final step ready to call a

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,850
navigator dot share that's before again

200
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,100
everything can fail in the simplest way

201
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,080
when the user cancels the sharing

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,820
operation so it's all wrapped in

203
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,700
try-catch blocks as before I use a

204
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,380
progressive enhancement loading strategy

205
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,050
if both share and can share exists on a

206
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,360
navigator object only then I go forward

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,430
and load shared on MJS why a dynamic

208
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,650
import on browsers like mobile safari

209
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,510
that only fulfill one of the two

210
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,050
conditions

211
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,780
I don't load the full functionality if I

212
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,190
tap the share button on a supporting

213
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,440
browser the native share sheet opens I

214
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,060
can for example choose

215
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,890
Gmail and the email composer Richard

216
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,560
pops up with the image attached up next

217
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,780
I want to talk about contacts and when I

218
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,420
say contacts I mean contacts as in the

219
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,400
devices address book when you write a

220
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
greeting card it may not always be easy

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,510
to correctly write someone's name for

222
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,310
example I have a friend who prefers the

223
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,720
name to be spelled in Cyrillic letters

224
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm using a German qwertz keyboard and I

225
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,700
have no idea how to type their name this

226
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,380
is a problem that the contact picker API

227
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,630
sells since I have my friends stored in

228
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,880
my phone's contacts app by the contacts

229
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,130
picker API I can tap into my contacts

230
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,950
from the web first I need to specify the

231
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,540
list of properties I want to access in

232
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,390
this case I only want the names but for

233
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,190
the use cases I might be interested in

234
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,220
telephone numbers emails avatar icon or

235
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,160
physical addresses next I configure an

236
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,320
options object and set multiples to true

237
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,140
so you can select more than one account

238
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,880
finally I can call navigator

239
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,920
contacts that select which results in

240
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,690
the desired properties once the user

241
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,250
selects one or multiple of their

242
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,830
contacts in fugu greetings when I tap

243
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,870
the contacts button and select that two

244
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,540
best pals said again makarevich Bryn and

245
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,210
Laurence Edward Larry Page you can see

246
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,070
how the contacts picker is limited to

247
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,170
only show their names but not their

248
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,460
email addresses or other information

249
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,100
like their phone numbers the names are

250
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,350
then drawn onto my greeting card and by

251
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,270
now you probably learned the pattern I

252
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,610
only load the file when the API is

253
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,030
actually supported up next is copying

254
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,710
and pasting one of our favorite

255
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,330
operations as software developers is

256
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,400
copy and paste as greeting card

257
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,920
elephants at times and I want to do the

258
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,810
same either paste an image into a

259
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,790
greeting card and working on or on the

260
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,420
other way around

261
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,610
copy my greeting card so I can continue

262
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,800
editing it from somewhere else the I

263
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,350
simplified API about from text also

264
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,390
supports images let me walk you through

265
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,790
how I have added copy and paste to the

266
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,950
fugu breeding set in order to copy

267
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,570
something onto the system's clipboard

268
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,090
you need to write to it the navigated

269
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,370
clipboard right method takes an area of

270
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,840
clipper items as a parameter

271
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,120
each kept one item essentially as an

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,250
object with a blob as a value and the

273
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,820
blocks type as the key to paste I need

274
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,650
to loop over the clipboard items that

275
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,240
are obtained by calling navigated or

276
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
clipboard Audrey the reason for this is

277
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,470
that multiple clipboard items might be

278
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,850
on the clipboard in different

279
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,220
representations each clip pod item has a

280
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,110
types field that tells me in which mine

281
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,630
type the resource is available I simply

282
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,100
take the first one and call the

283
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,660
clipboard items get a type method

284
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,760
passing the mime type I obtained before

285
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,000
and almost needless to say by now I only

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,640
do this on supporting browsers so how

287
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,070
does this work here I have an image open

288
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,990
and the Mac OS preview app and copy it

289
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,690
to the clipboard when I click paste the

290
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,580
fugu breeding zap then asks me what I

291
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,290
want to allow the app to see texts and

292
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,690
images on the clipboard finally after

293
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,730
accepting the permission the images then

294
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,010
paste it into the application the other

295
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,290
way round works to let me copy a

296
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,210
greeting card to the clipboard when I

297
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,310
then open preview and click file and

298
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,130
then new from clipboard the greeting

299
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,960
card gets pasted into a new untitled

300
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,810
image another useful API is the badging

301
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,500
AJ

302
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,350
as an installable PWI fugu greetings of

303
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,660
course does have an app icon that users

304
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,430
can place on the app dock or the home

305
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,470
screen something fun to do with it in

306
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,570
the context of frugal greetings miss use

307
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,670
it as a pen stroke counter with a

308
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,350
batting okay it is a straightforward

309
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,720
task to do this I have added an event

310
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,280
less than that on pointed down

311
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,230
increments the pen strokes counter and

312
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,900
sets the icon whenever the canvas gets

313
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,880
cleared the counter resets and the badge

314
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,460
is removed in this example I've drawn

315
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,860
the numbers from 1 to 7 using one pen

316
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,050
stroke for each number the batch counter

317
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,020
on the icon is now at 7 this feature is

318
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,490
a progressive enhancement so the loading

319
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,160
logic is as usual want to start each day

320
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,980
fresh with something new a neat feature

321
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,320
of the fugu greetings app is that it can

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
inspire you each morning with a new

323
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,590
background image to study a breeding

324
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,930
card the app uses two prokaryotic

325
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,300
background sync API to achieve this the

326
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,040
first step is to register a periodic

327
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,090
sync event in the serviceworker

328
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,820
registration it listens for a sync tag

329
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,270
called

330
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,010
image of the day and as a minimum

331
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,110
interval of one day so the user can get

332
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,320
a new background image every 24 hours

333
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,550
the second step is to listen for the

334
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,260
periodic sync event in the serviceworker

335
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,480
if Devon Tech is the one that was

336
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,760
registered a slide ago the image of the

337
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
day is retrieved for the get image of

338
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,210
the day function and the result

339
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,490
propagated to all clients so they can

340
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,100
update their chemists and captions again

341
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,510
this is truly a progressive enhancement

342
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,820
so the code is only loaded when the API

343
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,190
is supported by the browser this applies

344
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,840
to both the client code and the

345
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,970
serviceworker code on lan supporting

346
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,400
browsers me of them is loaded note how

347
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,660
in the serviceworker instead of a

348
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,090
dynamic input I use the classic import

349
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,920
scripts function to the same effect

350
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,290
sometimes even with a lot of inspiration

351
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,300
you need a nudge to finish it started

352
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,160
reading code this is a feature that is

353
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,170
enabled by the notification triggers API

354
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,900
as a user I can enter a time and I want

355
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,550
to be nudged to finish my greeting card

356
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,380
and when the time has come and I get a

357
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,970
notification that my greeting card is

358
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,860
waiting after prompting for the target

359
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,600
time the application schedules a

360
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,610
notification with the show trigger this

361
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,170
can be a timestamp trigger with a

362
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,690
previously selected target date the

363
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,070
reminder notification will be triggered

364
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,230
locally no network or server-side is

365
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,210
necessary as everything else i've shown

366
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,010
so far this is a progressive enhancement

367
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,570
so the code is

368
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,580
me conditionally loaded I also want to

369
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,340
talk about the wakelock API sometimes

370
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,930
you need to just stare long enough on

371
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,000
the screen until the inspiration pieces

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,490
you the worst that can happen is for the

373
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,920
screen to turn off the way okay P I can

374
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,110
prevent this from happening in food

375
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,270
readings there's an insomnia checkbox

376
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,370
that when checked keeps your screen

377
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,740
awake in a first step they obtain a wake

378
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,390
lock with the Navigator table like dog

379
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,340
but request not a pass it the string

380
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,850
screen to obtain a screen leg lock I

381
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,020
then add an event listener to be

382
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,390
informed when the wake lock is released

383
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,860
this can happen for example when the tap

384
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,920
visibility changes if this happens I can

385
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,840
when this happens with will again we

386
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,910
obtain the wait look yes this is a

387
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,350
progressive announcement so you only

388
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,790
need to load it when the browser

389
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,820
supports the API at times even hysteria

390
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,060
the screen for hours is just useless the

391
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,800
idle detection API allows the app to

392
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,990
detect user idle time if the user's

393
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,480
detected to be idle for too long the app

394
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,250
resets to the initial state and clears

395
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,830
the canvas this API is currently gated

396
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,080
behind the notification permission since

397
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,790
a lot of production use cases of idle

398
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,460
detection or notification related for

399
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,290
example to only send a notification to a

400
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,270
device the user is currently actively

401
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,580
using after making sure that the

402
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,230
notifications permission is granted I

403
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,600
then instantiate the idle detector a

404
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
register an event listener that listens

405
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,800
for idle changes which includes the user

406
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,960
and the screen state the user can be

407
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
active or idle in a screen can be

408
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,430
unlocked or locked if the users detected

409
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,490
to be idle the chemist clears I give the

410
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,550
I detector a threshold of 60 seconds and

411
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,740
as always I unload this code and the

412
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,500
browser supports it whoo what a writer

413
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,100
so many ideas in just one sample app and

414
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,540
reminder we never make the use of pay

415
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,190
the download cost for a future that

416
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,320
their browser doesn't support by using

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
progressive enhancement and make sure

418
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,370
only the relevant code gets loaded and

419
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,070
since with HTTP 2 requests are cheap

420
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,110
this pattern should work well for a lot

421
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,480
of applications although at times you

422
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,160
might still want to consider a bundler

423
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,200
for really large apps this has been a

424
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,120
short overview of many of the ApS we're

425
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,530
working on in the context of project

426
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,780
Google definitely check out our landing

427
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,460
page they can find links to detailed

428
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,380
articles for each API that I've talked

429
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,100
about

430
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,810
if you're interested in FUBU greetings

431
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,660
go find and fork it on github and with

432
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,310
that thank you very much for watching my

433
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,650
talk you can find me as tomahawk on

434
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,760
github Twitter and the web in general
