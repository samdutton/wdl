4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,380
welcome back to web dev live as a Brit

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
and tickled to be kicking off day 2 from

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,230
an Amir friendly time zone yesterday we

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,699
spoke about government's doing great

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,640
work getting the word out on the web and

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,470
one of the most inspirational digital

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,170
services is from the UK where I saw a

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,090
government convened online for the first

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,219
time now we've all been learning how

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,070
best to work and learn from home and at

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,540
Google we're trying to get a deeper

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,010
understanding of the needs of web

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,899
developers partnering with the community

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,570
as one of our close partners I wanted to

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,550
invite our friends at Mozilla to chat

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,800
more about that work and also get

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,950
information on what's new in their world

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,920
welcome khadiyah and Victoria hi Deon

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,360
great to be here hey

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,480
so kadia web developers know mdn really

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,820
well and many may have participated in

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,219
the last DNA report but can you get us

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,750
up to speed a little bit and tell us

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,519
about its history and what we're trying

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,340
to do yeah of course so this really

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,670
started in late 2017

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,280
shortly after CSS great was shipped CSS

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,860
great was a massive success but was also

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
years in the making and layout had been

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,430
an issue for web developers at least

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,670
since the 90s when we abused tables

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,090
implement our UI designs so we asked

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,310
ourselves how can we have more of these

37
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,250
wins and we talked to people who worked

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,750
at the web platform at Mozilla about how

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
they prioritize things and one thing

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
really stood out because almost everyone

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,869
said the same thing they said we need to

42
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,060
hear more from developers and it makes

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,810
so much sense

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,970
because none of us can be successful

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,170
without that part it's hard to

46
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,610
prioritize the right thing without

47
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,159
knowing about developer pain points and

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,159
it's hard to find the right solution

49
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,649
especially if it and it's hard to get

50
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,869
people to use something if it's not

51
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,729
solving that problem or not solving it

52
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,189
in the right way so for all of those

53
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,350
reasons we proposed developer needs

54
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,250
assessment and the DNA in short is meant

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,830
to be a single and simple tool for harsh

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,740
characterization representing very

57
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,530
diverse populations and a huge future

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,680
space and it's publisher I'm Deanna

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,330
that's important because it's not owned

60
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,610
by a single browser vendor when you know

61
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,560
she initially proposed this under the

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
umbrella of the MDM product Advisory

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,580
Board where we have representation from

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,920
browser vendors like Google and

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,860
Microsoft and Samsung but also the w3c

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,340
and industry stakeholders and as a

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,950
community we need to have at least a

68
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,600
common understanding of the facts when

69
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,670
it comes to needs even if we draw

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,470
different conclusions from them and for

71
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,590
this situation in 2019 more than 20,000

72
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,000
developers and designers took the 20

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
minutes necessary to fully complete the

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,280
survey and that's from 173 countries

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,100
total and that's about ten thousand

76
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,400
hours of time contributed by developers

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,010
and designers to help us understand what

78
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,980
their pain points and needs are and we

79
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,290
believe that makes the amnion web DNA

80
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,360
the biggest web developer a design and

81
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,510
focus survey ever conducted so far yeah

82
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,250
well when you put it that way

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,709
just really want to say thank you to to

84
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,570
the community and anyone that took the

85
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,390
time to go through those you know 20

86
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,980
minutes and getting us the feedback it's

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,380
it's incredibly useful to us but but

88
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,330
thank you so much so when you were going

89
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,459
through the results

90
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,590
Kadir the 2019 report what kind of

91
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,320
really kind of stood out to you you know

92
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,519
one thing really

93
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,200
and that's web compatibility and

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,350
interoperability the four of the top

95
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,690
five issues were focused on exactly that

96
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,510
topic and one of the biggest strengths

97
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,890
of the web is that there is no single

98
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,680
entity controlling the platform but that

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,410
doesn't come for free web developers and

100
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,320
designers are frustrated by not being

101
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,800
able to use features by having to find

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,510
workarounds fiddling with browser

103
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,850
differences and also by the difficulty

104
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,100
to verify that something that works in

105
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,500
one browser will not break in another

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,010
browser and related to that it was a bit

107
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,650
of a surprise that the top five issues

108
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,440
were extremely stable between very

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,780
different markets so whether it's China

110
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,740
in the Japan the US or France the top

111
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,360
issues for web developers revolve around

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,750
web compatibility and interoperability

113
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,530
got it so when you take this feedback in

114
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,180
how does it actually kind of change the

115
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,280
roadmap at Mozilla like what are you now

116
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,870
looking to focus on based on this

117
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,270
feedback yeah so web config web

118
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,980
compatibility was already a focus at

119
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,320
Mozilla even before this but we now have

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
doubled down on it so recently we made

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,820
browser compatibility data machine

122
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,400
readable on MDM and that's now starting

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,660
to pay off so if you use yes code very

124
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,230
popular code editor the tooltips have

125
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,900
compact data information when you write

126
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,840
CSS and we also recently started a

127
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,750
collaboration with can I use comm to

128
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,580
share the data that we have so we are

129
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,919
all looking at the same browser company

130
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,680
information and I'm sure Victoria can

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,660
say more about it in a moment but the

132
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,790
Firefox dev tool say now come with

133
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,430
combat data information built-in got it

134
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,160
yeah this the feedback has been really

135
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,530
helpful for us and the web platform team

136
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,750
is really you know working even deeper

137
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,000
on stability compared issues that you

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,300
talked about helping with testing layout

139
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,240
really kind of understanding what what

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
the development needs are and kind of

141
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,630
bringing it into our prioritization too

142
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,880
so it's actually almost time for the

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
next version of the DNA report so what

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,020
do we have in store for developers this

145
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,410
time around yeah so one thing we are

146
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,240
super excited about this year is to see

147
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
how things have changed year-over-year

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,950
so we want to see that developer

149
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,790
satisfaction go up or down and however

150
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,570
the top pain points changed so this is

151
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,800
really the first opportunity to see

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
those trends well I can't wait to get

153
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,760
that out to developers and I hope that

154
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,580
everyone's watching would do us a favor

155
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,100
and take some time to to get that

156
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,050
feedback in so we can like really know

157
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,930
what we can prioritize in the future for

158
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,060
our roadmaps now Victoria I actually

159
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,190
used to work on there on developer tools

160
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,550
at Mozilla and not only was it the birth

161
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,289
of a you know great tooling in the

162
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,030
browser back from Joe Hewitt's you know

163
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,550
Firebug on words but it really continued

164
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,310
to push the bar so I'd love for you to

165
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,230
be able to kind of catch us up on what's

166
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,320
the latest what's new in in Firefox dev

167
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,160
tools hi Dan as Kadir explained we know

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,960
that differing browser support for CSS

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,870
features is a top issue for web devs so

170
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,000
our team built a compatibility panel to

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,980
make it easier to stay on top of this it

172
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,900
lists all CSS on your website that's

173
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,060
unsupported in certain browsers as well

174
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,670
as deprecated Styles you try it now in

175
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,190
Firefox dev edition I really love the

176
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,140
the UX touches there especially the

177
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,150
turtle and the like that's that's great

178
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,550
and in general you know a lot of great

179
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,530
features Lydia that I landed there and

180
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm curious if there's anything on the

181
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,970
upcoming roadmap that you're excited

182
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,100
about sharing we've also been working on

183
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,050
the Firefox profiler it's our

184
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,310
performance tool which features

185
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,500
shareable links for collaboration we've

186
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,480
been integrating the recorded UI into

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,550
Firefox so it's easy to get started this

188
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,680
tool is also currently in dev edition as

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,900
far as our debugger I want to highlight

190
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,780
two unique features in 77 we added a

191
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
type of break point that's new to

192
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,320
browser tools the watch point it let's

193
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,820
see pause when an object property is

194
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,640
accessed or changed also we made source

195
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,800
mapped variables work when you pause in

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,170
an original file we now reverse engineer

197
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,000
the scope chain so that variables look

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
correct in the scopes pane and work in

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,230
the console oh this was six months of

200
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,910
incredibly challenging work done by our

201
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,740
teammate Logan who had deep knowledge

202
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,630
for being tech lead on Babel the year

203
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,220
before we dropped that he's the only

204
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,480
person in the world who could have

205
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,850
written this so recently I really

206
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,620
embraced the open design process for a

207
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,470
network panel redesign we set and we

208
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,390
sent out a survey and posted early

209
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,980
mock-ups to Twitter and got amazing

210
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,250
input I originally used bold to indicate

211
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,500
large files and someone suggested it be

212
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,060
more clear to have Mouse and elephant

213
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,070
icons for small and big that's how we

214
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,870
ended up with the turtle for slow

215
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,440
responses people also told us that when

216
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,420
it comes to the domain column they

217
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,010
mainly want to know if it's third-party

218
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,130
or not so in this condensed view with a

219
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,230
sidebar we hid the domain column and add

220
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,060
an icon that indicates third-party

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,060
requests originally I made these

222
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,070
brightly-colored file type icons and

223
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,900
some people love them and others said it

224
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,750
was too much label like candy so i ated

225
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,350
tone down

226
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,970
colors and got to the result you see

227
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,370
here most of this has landed in the

228
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,110
latest nightly we hope everyone will try

229
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,680
it out and give us more feedback awesome

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,790
great so Victoria

231
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,070
Kadir thank you so much for taking the

232
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,660
time to join us today we really

233
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,430
appreciate the great work the Mozilla

234
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,190
continues to do for the web now you

235
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,020
spend a lot of time both in your

236
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,180
developer tools and also on the core

237
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,010
task of building your app UI

238
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,710
so to chat more about modern web UI

239
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,880
let's welcome you now idea hi Yuna now

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,170
we were just talking about the develop

241
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,300
and need survey with Mozilla and there

242
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,130
was plenty of feedback from developers

243
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,350
on layout so I was just curious you know

244
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,760
there any recent additions to the

245
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,500
platform that you think target these

246
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,110
needs oh yes you've definitely been

247
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,570
listening and CSS has been evolving so

248
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,910
rapidly in the past few years and really

249
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,640
months so tomorrow I'll be going over a

250
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,710
ton of cool aspects of modern layout

251
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,300
with CSS grid and flexbox

252
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,130
including how to harness the power of

253
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,650
CSS functions like clamp fractional

254
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,630
units Auto placement the min max

255
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,750
function justification place items the

256
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,150
VP function and a lot more to create

257
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,100
robust layouts breaking down how

258
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,920
powerful a single line of CSS can be

259
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,440
there are also some CSS properties

260
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
coming down the pipeline that will help

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,740
with a lot of user needs that haven't

262
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,320
yet been met an aspect ratio is one of

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
them this just landed in Chrome Canary

264
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,000
and it enables users set to find width

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,310
to height ratios for media items like

266
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,890
images and video previously the way to

267
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,750
do this was a hack using padding and

268
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,180
calculating a percentage but now you can

269
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
set your ratios in a much more readable

270
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,170
way I'm looking forward to the planning

271
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,520
and browsers and making a lot of

272
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,470
developers lives easier because I know

273
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,030
this is something that I run into a lot

274
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,550
we're also getting the gap property in

275
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,190
Flex box this one is exciting because of

276
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,410
how many times we've just been styling a

277
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,270
series of items and wanting there to be

278
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,310
space between those items but not around

279
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,160
those items gap enables the parent

280
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,960
element to control spacing not the

281
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,940
children making it easier to style these

282
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,240
items uniformly within that parent

283
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,440
currently you can use gap to create

284
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,810
tracks with CSS grid but you'll be able

285
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,180
to use with a flexbox layout too meaning

286
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,890
you can leverage all the benefits of gap

287
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,680
with the greater

288
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,470
choice and layout mechanism the web

289
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,870
animations API is also getting a lot

290
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,720
more robust in chromium 84 now we have

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,520
promises replaceable animations

292
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,890
composite modes partial keyframes and a

293
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,050
way to access animations from CSS and

294
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,360
JavaScript check out the blog post on

295
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,890
web app dev for more information about

296
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,600
these updates and try them out in Chrome

297
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,480
Canary yourself the act property rule is

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,250
also available behind a flag and canary

299
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,959
and something that I am particularly

300
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,730
excited about because this allows for

301
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,490
semantic variables in CSS with a

302
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,500
property you can declare a CSS custom

303
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,630
properties that have semantics typed

304
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,180
values and fallbacks this is the part of

305
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,760
the CSS Houdini effort specifically the

306
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,430
properties and values API and previously

307
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,680
was possible in JavaScript with CSS to

308
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,390
register property as a part of Houdini

309
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,640
but the app property declaration brings

310
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,010
us into our CSS files meaning a nice

311
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,350
collocation of super-powered styles with

312
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,899
the rest of your CSS the other Houdini

313
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,640
API is to keep an eye out for our the

314
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
type object model the paint worklets

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,720
animation workbook and the layout work

316
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,150
with great so javascript seems to kind

317
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,950
of have its time with the addition of

318
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,400
async away yes modules and the like it

319
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,230
was great to see that evolution it's

320
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,000
really feeling like this is a big time

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,430
for for CSS I love being able to get

322
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,589
features that like gap that you made

323
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:27,880
though you mentioned and the like to

324
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,190
just make things a lot easier for us and

325
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,800
super excited at how deep you can get

326
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,980
into on the Houdini side too but if I

327
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,750
use these and I'm building these super

328
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,510
rich designs and the like with this

329
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,920
great power comes great responsibility

330
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,839
so how do you think about the role of

331
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,930
accessibility here I love that you bring

332
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,520
up accessibility because accessibility

333
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,529
should always come first I think you're

334
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,970
absolutely right that that needs to be

335
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,310
top of mind your users need to be able

336
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,170
to access your content and navigate your

337
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,959
product it is not an enhancement I think

338
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,670
of accessibility as a core feature and

339
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,160
from 83 actually just launched with some

340
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,290
new accessibility testing features which

341
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,209
are pretty neat because they allow for

342
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,670
visual accessibility testing so now

343
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,410
their dev tools you can examine if your

344
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,060
UI works for users with the various

345
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,130
vision deficiency is like blurred vision

346
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,990
and for different types of

347
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,060
colorblindness yeah it's great we're

348
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,500
actually gonna have pool Luis come on

349
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,170
then kind of

350
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,600
through that a little bit and so thanks

351
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,250
so much I also have really been enjoying

352
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,920
your new CSS podcast with Adam Argyle

353
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,810
not only are you both kind of like

354
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,220
really fun to listen to him the like

355
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,620
it's actually been really interesting to

356
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,149
what you kind of go through step by step

357
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,800
and kind of teach us the fundamentals

358
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,870
there was a lot that I didn't really

359
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,000
know about yeah honestly we're learning

360
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,860
so much as we are going through the

361
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,480
fundamentals and we're having a lot of

362
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,940
fun making these episodes so if you

363
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,920
haven't seen it yet check out the CSS

364
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,160
podcast absolutely so thanks so much for

365
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,290
joining us Yuna and we'll see you later

366
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,800
on the stream bye now there are a few

367
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,690
more dev tools features I'm really keen

368
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,180
to show you and no one's better to show

369
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,740
off a bit all-in than the ever

370
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,300
supercharged Paul Lewis

371
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,149
hey how you doing not too bad how you

372
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,910
doing mate yep pretty good thanks

373
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,620
alright so one of the things that we've

374
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,079
noticed is that dev tools puts out these

375
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,389
console warnings as you can see on

376
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,920
screen and if you're anything like me

377
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,529
after a while you start to ignore them

378
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,269
and the reason is that that just could

379
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,889
be quite a lot of them so we've been

380
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,660
thinking about that and what we decided

381
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,959
to do is to bring in the issues tab now

382
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,029
if we detect issues on your page you'll

383
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,250
see this bar across the top with a

384
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,120
button in the top right hand corner

385
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,310
there that says go to issues if you

386
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,440
click on that it'll take you through to

387
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,209
the issues tab now you might offer you

388
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:43,459
the opportunity to reload the page to

389
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,070
get more information if you click on one

390
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,660
of these items it'll expand and you can

391
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,490
see more information there as well as

392
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,230
potentially some links to content for

393
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,300
you to read up on what you could do to

394
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
fix the issue so that's the issues tab

395
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,250
the other thing we've been looking at is

396
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,760
Web vitals so if you go to web dev slash

397
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,069
metrics you'll see a whole list of

398
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,779
metrics here that affect the UX and

399
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,550
things that we would like to optimize as

400
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,870
web developers and we've been looking at

401
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,760
ways of exposing this information to you

402
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,010
inside of the dev tools UI so things

403
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,440
like first content full paint or largest

404
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,750
content for paint for example so if you

405
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,880
go to the performance tab in dev tools

406
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,279
and you take a recording in the

407
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,230
performance tab you'll see something

408
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,709
that looks like this now there is a

409
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,940
timings tab there what time use row

410
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,829
sorry I should say across which you'll

411
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,990
see these blocks and these relate to

412
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,660
some of those metrics so you can see

413
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,990
P&L CP first contact 4p largest contact

414
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,759
for patrons so on so you can start to

415
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,860
get information there on some of your

416
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,740
metrics the other thing we started doing

417
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,899
is to add candy striping to your

418
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,759
long-running tasks and you can see that

419
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,220
here I have one task on my main thread

420
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,649
that is 17 milliseconds long and what

421
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:54,759
we're looking for is we're looking for

422
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,459
tasks to remain under 50 milliseconds

423
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:58,629
this means that the main thread stays

424
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:00,730
responsive and hopefully we can respond

425
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,009
to user interactions quickly so as you

426
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,750
look around your performance recording

427
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,370
if you see this can't distracting effect

428
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,930
and the red triangle in the corner you

429
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,129
know that you've got a task that's

430
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:11,800
running longer than 50 milliseconds what

431
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,449
we've also added as well is we've added

432
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,310
a tons of blocking time footer at the

433
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,680
bottom what this tells you is if you

434
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,810
like the amount of candy striping that

435
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,610
you would see across the whole recording

436
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,740
so as you're looking around if you see

437
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,060
that that numbers going up you might

438
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,290
want to take a look and see if you have

439
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,209
a lot of long running tasks on your main

440
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,129
thread bringing that down should

441
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,069
hopefully help your user experience

442
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,939
another thing that we've added is this

443
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,550
experience track and what's contained

444
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,889
within this is layout shift information

445
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,350
so for example when you've got buttons

446
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,579
and so on on your page and they're

447
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,279
perhaps moving around this can cause you

448
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,170
X discomfort so what we want to do is we

449
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,000
want to minimize the amount of moving

450
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,160
elements on the page and so the layout

451
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,110
shift here is going to tell you what

452
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,269
elements are moving on the page and

453
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,970
where and so on and the size that they

454
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,259
were when they did it so if I look at

455
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:02,110
this I have a warning here which tells

456
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,000
me that qtip layouts can result in poor

457
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,530
user experiences and that's a link to

458
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,419
more information as well as information

459
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,089
on where is moved from and - and if I

460
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,220
roll over that I get an overlay on my

461
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,350
screen which shows me exactly where on

462
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,799
my page the shift took place you can

463
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,380
also get live information about layout

464
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,299
shifts by going to the rendering tab and

465
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,699
choosing layout shift regions here in

466
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,100
the options now I should say that for

467
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,289
people prone to photosensitive epilepsy

468
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,700
this might be a less suitable option

469
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,049
because it can cause flushing or

470
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,240
overlays on the screen but it is there

471
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
as an option if it's suitable for you

472
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,450
the next thing I want to talk about is

473
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,280
web assembly debugging and it's an

474
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,140
experiment so if you go into your dev

475
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,270
tool settings go to these parents tab

476
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,460
and click on web assembly debugging you

477
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,799
can switch it on there well this allows

478
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,330
you to

479
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,800
is allows you to do things like setting

480
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,930
breakpoints in your web assembly code so

481
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,240
here I've compiled a C program it's just

482
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
a hello world program but what I've done

483
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
is I've added a breakpoint on the line

484
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,270
that says hello world so when this code

485
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,340
executes and it hits that line inside of

486
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,380
the web assembly it pauses execution

487
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,940
just like it would inside the JavaScript

488
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,620
and you can see here in the call stack

489
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,360
that I can actually take a look at

490
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,550
what's going on in that particular frame

491
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,170
and I can go between my JavaScript and

492
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,450
the C and so on and so forth so that's

493
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,920
something that's coming down and it's

494
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,780
currently in canary so take a look at

495
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,880
that now the last thing I want to show

496
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,250
you is color vision deficiency emulation

497
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,930
inside of dev tools and there's no

498
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,280
better way to do that than to actually

499
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,450
give you a demo ok so here I am in

500
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,650
Chrome Canary and I have a video here

501
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,330
running of me and server doing

502
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,580
supercharged yesteryear but you see I

503
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,470
have the rendering tab open in dev tools

504
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,720
and I can emulate various vision

505
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,540
deficiencies such as blurred vision or I

506
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:48,170
can do protanopia I can do deuteron Opia

507
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,180
protanopia I will straight right in Opa

508
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,680
a chroma top to you as well so you can

509
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,380
see the live effect that it has on the

510
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,240
page so these are physiologically

511
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,950
accurate emulations of various vision

512
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,420
deficiencies now a vision deficiency

513
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,850
isn't an on/off thing let me see here

514
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,950
but rather it's a spectrum so a person

515
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,080
could have a milder form of a vision

516
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,120
deficiency or a more acute form what

517
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,380
we've chosen to implement inside of the

518
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,200
dev tools UI is the most acute form the

519
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,460
theory being that as you're optimizing

520
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,140
your app for accessibility in terms of

521
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,420
color and contrast if you make it work

522
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
for the most acute form then you'll

523
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,330
include everything up to and including

524
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,130
that as well

525
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,279
so that's color vision deficiency

526
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,299
emulation inside of dev tools thanks

527
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,470
Paul I'm really looking forward to

528
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,380
seeing more later today

529
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,909
now one thing I've noticed as we work

530
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,950
from home is how seriously people are

531
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,559
taking their home setups whether it be

532
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,779
playing with mics and cameras or virtual

533
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:48,690
backgrounds and recently I saw a demo

534
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,460
that would make you invisible on your

535
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,640
video feed using tensorflow j/s so I've

536
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,720
really wanted to learn more

537
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,330
so please welcome Jason maze from the

538
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,769
tensorflow Jas team

539
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,350
hi there I'm Jason and thank you for the

540
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,760
introduction there it's pleasure to be

541
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,669
invited to the show and yes I have

542
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,139
created an invisibility cloak

543
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,880
so maybe you would learn more about that

544
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,309
yeah Jason invisibility cloaks are

545
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:14,220
pretty cool and so maybe you can show us

546
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,480
how web developers can create

547
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,309
superpowers like that with tensive law

548
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:18,570
sure definitely

549
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,789
so if I switch to my slides for just a

550
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,250
second you can see what the invisibility

551
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,230
cloak was that Zeon was referring to you

552
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,870
and in this demonstration on the right

553
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,460
hand side you can see as I get on the

554
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,860
bed the bed is deforming in real time

555
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,720
and I'm being removed from the bottom

556
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,429
frame at the same time and this is

557
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:37,769
running all in the web browser now this

558
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,269
is pretty cool because privacy is

559
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,700
preserved as none of these images are

560
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,039
being sent to the server site and that's

561
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,539
super powerful especially in today's

562
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,240
climate where privacy is top of mind now

563
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,580
this was created in just under a day in

564
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,320
fact so it's quite easy to get started

565
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,760
with machine learning in the web browser

566
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,889
and we'll see some more demos in just a

567
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:59,580
second so on that note I also created a

568
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,919
Chrome extension that allows me to use

569
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,860
the same stuff we saw before as I using

570
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,539
body pics to create that which gives me

571
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,250
this image segmentation of my body in

572
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,260
real time and I can now join a Google

573
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,320
meet meeting as you can see shown on the

574
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,450
side right now and this can be combined

575
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,309
with my previous demo so I can remove

576
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,019
that second person who comes into frame

577
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,049
halfway through the gif and then it

578
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,490
would appear as if it never actually

579
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,610
happened cool so can you give us a few

580
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,880
more details on how this all works so

581
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,260
essentially all this is using body

582
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,149
segmentation and this is running

583
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,769
intensive projects in the web browser

584
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,830
and this can distinguish 24 unique body

585
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,230
areas across multiple bodies in real

586
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,280
time you can see

587
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,750
on the right-hand side that this works

588
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,100
pretty well when it all those settings

589
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,930
are bumped up too high and you can even

590
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,090
get the pose estimation showing on the

591
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,440
bodies to which estimated where the

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,510
skeleton is these can be used in

593
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,700
delightful ways juts as clothing size

594
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,290
estimation which you can see here this

595
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,060
is not a prototype I created and I don't

596
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,160
know about you Theon but I am terrible

597
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,990
at knowing what size clothing to buy I

598
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,420
mean by once a year clothing purchase so

599
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,810
absolutely yeah totally and here you can

600
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,850
see I just enter my height and in less

601
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,250
than 15 seconds I think an estimate of

602
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,230
my inner leg my chest and waist

603
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,180
measurements which for clothing sight

604
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,340
can then use to estimate what size I am

605
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,010
a small medium or large

606
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,030
now this can even give you superpowers

607
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,460
ACC on this next slide and what about

608
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,590
community members from the USA has

609
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,990
combined this with WebGL shaders to turn

610
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,640
himself into Iron Man of sorts that he

611
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,200
can shoot lasers from its eyes and mouth

612
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,350
using our face mesh model so this is

613
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,910
pretty cool and it runs buttery smooth

614
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,590
at 60 frames per second in the web

615
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,500
browser and you can even go further of

616
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,030
course there's many web technologies out

617
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,350
there but you might want to combine with

618
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,050
machine learning such as web X our WebGL

619
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,780
and use very intensive OGS and if you do

620
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,460
that you can get an example like this

621
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,810
from another one of our community

622
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,910
members in Paris France who can

623
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,310
essentially scan a magazine and if

624
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,660
there's a person in it they can bring

625
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,640
that person into the living room full

626
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,920
size you can walk up to them and inspect

627
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,810
them in more detail pretty cool

628
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,910
technology but of course after seeing

629
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,590
this I thought to go one step further

630
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,710
and if I add web RTC I can bend teleport

631
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,510
myself anywhere in the world in real

632
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,810
time and this is using complete rewrite

633
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,440
using WebRTC a frame 3GS and 10 suppose

634
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,590
yes together to create this demo and it

635
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,090
really does make a big difference when

636
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm seeing someone in my room which I

637
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,070
can walk up to and move around

638
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,200
it's a massive difference compared to a

639
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,750
rectangle that's solid on the screen so

640
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,770
this could be the future of video

641
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,660
conferencing who knows but it's great to

642
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,010
play these technologies have pushed the

643
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,680
boundaries of the web that's really cool

644
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,510
from invisibility cloaks to

645
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,080
teleportation that's that's pretty cool

646
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,650
stuff yeah exactly

647
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,720
this changes everything is anything so

648
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,820
how should web developers if we kind of

649
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,909
zoom out a second

650
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:58,429
how do web developers kind of

651
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:00,440
generically think about the role of ml

652
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,419
in tensorflow j/s and how it could fit

653
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:05,630
into their web applications yeah that's

654
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,730
a great question and obviously right now

655
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,490
in fact machine learning in JavaScript

656
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,200
is still a pretty new thing right the

657
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,760
very early stages but that's super

658
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,230
exciting too because there's so much

659
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,020
potential to be unraveled at this time

660
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,080
as well so on that note I had asked web

661
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,059
developers to consider how a machine

662
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,409
learning might fit into their existing

663
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:27,200
pipelines maybe you're developing a

664
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,150
content management system in that case

665
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,960
you could potentially use something like

666
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,520
automatic image cropping to detect where

667
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,860
a human faces in the image so then you

668
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,080
can make sure that it's cropped nicely

669
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,740
when you're resizing with your CSS or

670
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,900
maybe you want to summarize a blog post

671
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,760
article so you have one paragraph of

672
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,890
text that shows MD search results that's

673
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,570
now possible of machine learning - and

674
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,490
that can be done automatically so I

675
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,289
think only coach people to experiment

676
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:57,020
and and go outside of the regular box or

677
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,390
thinking and of course on that note on

678
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,860
this side you can see all the different

679
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,070
areas JavaScript can run on the browser

680
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,380
server-side mobile native desktop native

681
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,270
and even Internet of Things and tensor

682
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,500
phones jes supports all of these

683
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,539
environments too so maybe you want to

684
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,830
combine it with hardware if you can

685
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,330
recognize an object maybe you can

686
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,470
trigger something to happen in the

687
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,240
physical world or something on the

688
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,650
surface I if I talk to a third-party

689
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,100
service and on that note tensorflow Jess

690
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,799
can essentially run retrain by transfer

691
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,080
learning or even write allow you to

692
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,970
write your own models from scratch if

693
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,360
you so desire now on that note we have a

694
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,980
ton of pre frame models you can use to

695
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,150
get started such as the body

696
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,740
segmentation you saw just a little bit

697
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,070
ago but also things that pose estimation

698
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,650
speech commands base mesh hand pose and

699
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,179
some cool natural language processing

700
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,549
and just to dive into that a little bit

701
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,200
more you can see how these models work

702
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,390
here so here's the object recognition in

703
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,970
action this class allows you to

704
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,270
recognize 90 pre-trained objects that

705
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,590
cookies dock you can see here and you

706
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,090
get the bounding boxes that come back at

707
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,860
the same time which is pretty neat or

708
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,140
what about this face mesh just three

709
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,380
megabytes in size and you can understand

710
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,260
468 unique landmarks on her face

711
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,330
and this could be cool for making face

712
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,670
masks or some kind of AR experience such

713
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,530
as the one you see on the right Madhi

714
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,150
face which is part of a loyal group has

715
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,220
actually uses for AR makeup try on and

716
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,900
this lady on the right hand side is not

717
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,700
actually wearing any makeup at all in

718
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,130
fact she's selecting the color of makeup

719
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,840
she wants to try on and she can do that

720
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,850
all in real time in the web browser in a

721
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,290
much more hygienic way which is pretty

722
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,270
cool and then finally I just want to

723
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,830
talk about some of the client-side

724
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,170
superpowers you get if we think about

725
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,580
running machine running in the web

726
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,060
browser

727
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,670
the first one is privacy as we hinted at

728
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,890
before essentially because we're running

729
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,330
in the web browser

730
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,160
none of that data is ever being sent to

731
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,050
a server for classification so that

732
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,760
allows you to access for sensor data in

733
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,850
a way that is great for privacy linked

734
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,500
to that of course is lower latency as

735
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,420
there's no server involved that means

736
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,830
there's no hundred milliseconds or so

737
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,750
round-trip time from the mobile device

738
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,490
to the server you cut out completely by

739
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,560
running on the edge and of course lower

740
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,630
costs you might spend tens of thousands

741
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,130
of dollars

742
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,350
hiring beefy GPUs and CPUs to run the

743
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,790
machines any models on your server-side

744
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,160
environments by running on the client

745
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,480
side all of that goes away because

746
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,890
you're using the hardware of the client

747
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,090
to run instead got it so how can people

748
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,740
get started you've definitely piqued my

749
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,750
interest now I want to know when I start

750
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,980
playing ok sounds good so if there's one

751
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,540
slide you want to kind of screenshot

752
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
from today's talk it would be this one

753
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,380
here on this site you can find out our

754
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,690
websites our models github code we are

755
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,280
open source or feel free to contribute

756
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,080
there's a Google group for asking more

757
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,670
technical questions and of course some

758
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,260
great boilerplates to get started on

759
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,570
code pen and Glitch and for those of you

760
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,730
want to go really deep we recommend for

761
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,990
deep learning with JavaScript book

762
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,850
that's very comprehensive and even if

763
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,870
you have no background in machine

764
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,850
learning as long as you know some

765
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,990
JavaScript it will walk you through

766
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,030
everything step-by-step so I highly

767
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,430
recommend checking that out and on that

768
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,080
note I would also suggest checking out

769
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,730
teach or machine right after this show

770
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,800
maybe in just two minutes you can use

771
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,320
this website to learn to recognize any

772
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,930
object in your room in just thirty

773
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,340
seconds you just take a few images of

774
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,560
that thing hit train and you'll get a

775
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,740
classifier that can then classify that

776
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,110
object if you like it you can export

777
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,180
this model to a JSON format and then use

778
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,650
it on any website you like to be more

779
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,970
creative and

780
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,400
makes your own creations using that and

781
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,679
then finally I'd ask you to come join

782
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,690
the community we've got this made with

783
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,120
TFG a hashtag that you can use that

784
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,580
allows you to share what you've made so

785
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,410
we can find it and we can invite you to

786
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,940
our future showing tells and of course

787
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,710
that others to get inspired by your

788
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,900
great work too so finally I just want to

789
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,309
leave you with one more inspirational

790
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,250
example this guy from Tokyo in Japan is

791
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,929
actually a dancer

792
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,780
but he's used temps of hojae s to make

793
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,120
this cool hip-hop video so machine

794
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,830
learning really is now for everyone and

795
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,780
I'm super excited to see how creatives

796
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,340
will start using this and not just

797
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,179
academics musicians artists and much

798
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,340
much more so if you do make something do

799
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,230
use a major of TF J's hashtag so we can

800
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,059
find it and share it for you and I look

801
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,130
