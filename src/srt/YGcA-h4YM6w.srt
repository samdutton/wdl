00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,410
hi everyone thanks for joining me my

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,269
name is Rick disco me I'm an engineer

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,740
and developer advocate on web

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,140
transparency projects at Google

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,099
including the chrome user experience

7
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:22,550
support or crux for short as you may

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,140
know crux is a powerful data set

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,180
containing insights about how real users

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,399
experience the web and this data set

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,349
goes all the way back to late 2017 and

12
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:32,239
includes data from over 18 million

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,780
websites this will be a somewhat

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,820
advanced presentation so if you want to

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,649
brush up on the basics you can visit the

16
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,050
crux docks at bitly slash chrome UX

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,789
report to learn about things like

18
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,190
metrics dimensions best practices and

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,399
more what I'll be sharing with you today

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,530
are a few pro tips for mining the

21
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,749
low-level data set on bigquery for

22
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:54,949
insights about how users are

23
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:57,890
experiencing the web so by now I'm sure

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,140
you've heard of core web vitals there

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,789
are the most important UX metrics we

26
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,409
think you should be looking at in 2020

27
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:08,200
the list includes LCP FID and CLS in

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,640
fact Kruk supports all three of these

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,590
metrics and has months of data across

30
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,300
millions of websites so let's head over

31
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,190
to bigquery to see what we can find here

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,590
I'm querying the metrics summary table

33
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,910
which is a really quick and easy way to

34
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,070
get high-level stats about a website's

35
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,830
core web vitals you can see here that

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,240
we're extracting the percent of user

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,560
experiences that meet the good

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,640
thresholds for LCP FID and CLS as well

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,780
as metrics 75th percentiles all of these

40
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,520
stats are pre computed for you so you

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,320
can spend more time finding insights and

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,590
less time writing queries this summary

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,360
table is also much smaller and more

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,310
efficient you can see it processes only

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,170
about a hundred megabytes so you

46
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,220
shouldn't have any concerns about

47
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,930
exceeding your one terabyte of free

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,350
monthly quota the raw data still exists

49
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,150
if you need access to specific histogram

50
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,370
bins but almost everything you need is

51
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,160
here in the materialized data set if

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,660
you've ever queried the raw data you'll

53
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,040
know that there are several useful

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,509
dimensions that you can drill down on

55
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,890
like month device type and country so

56
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,180
let's look at a few examples of doing

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,450
that efficiently with the summary table

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,860
the first thing we'll do is modify this

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,840
query to see how the core web vitals

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,660
have changed in recent months to do that

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,130
we need to change our where clause to

62
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,800
include all releases in 2020 by setting

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,690
the condition to date greater than 20

64
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:37,820
2001 oh 1 or January 2020 next we

65
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,170
include the year and month of the

66
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,090
release and the select clause so we can

67
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,190
see it in the output the difference

68
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,440
between year month and date is that the

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,690
tables are partitioned by date while the

70
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,250
yeren month corresponds to the table

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,350
names in the raw data set and finally we

72
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,150
can sort the results chronologically and

73
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:10,400
run the query you can see from the

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,380
results that web dev has had relatively

75
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,180
stable and good user experience this

76
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,700
year but what if we want to break this

77
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,530
down by desktop and phone experiences

78
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,510
for that all we need to do is change

79
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,380
over to the device summary table will

80
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,150
restrict the results to only desktop in

81
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,489
phone results now tablet is available

82
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:42,850
but it's less interesting

83
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,000
next we'll add the device name to the

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,040
select clause and secondary sort by it

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
to keep the ordering of the results

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,490
consistent I'm going to run this query

87
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,720
but there's one thing I wanted to show

88
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
you in the results these percentages are

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,800
out of all user experiences on the

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,960
origin not just the percent of desktop

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,000
experiences or the percent of phone

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,190
experiences for boring technical reasons

93
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,140
so one less thing we need to do is

94
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,300
normalize these distributions so it

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,680
doesn't matter that desktop is more

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
popular than phone to do that we just

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:29,420
divide the metric by the total

98
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,810
now we have comparable results between

99
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,550
devices and we can see that desktop

100
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,080
actually trends slightly better than

101
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,080
phone and finally what if we want to

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,819
break this down even further by users

103
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,979
countries for that we can change over to

104
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:50,349
the country summary table for

105
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,060
demonstration purposes let's restrict

106
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,560
the results to two countries with very

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,780
different experiences Korea and Nigeria

108
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:08,050
and focus only on desktop now we could

109
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,520
write the country code to the results

110
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,780
but I wanted to show you one other cool

111
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,849
trick the crux data set includes an

112
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,590
experimental function to map country

113
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:33,380
codes to full names

114
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,190
and the last thing we'll do before

115
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,990
running the query is to sort by country

116
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:49,210
rather than device the results tell a

117
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,890
really interesting story about the

118
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,780
disparity and user experience by country

119
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,790
and bakery was able to analyze this in

120
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,860
only a couple of seconds and using only

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,550
about a gigabyte of data so that's it

122
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,170
these are just a few quick examples of

123
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,700
the power of the bigquery data set and

124
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,410
it doesn't have to be mysterious or

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,390
expensive I hope you start exploring the

126
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,040
data set and finding insights about the

127
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,530
state of the web you can find links to

128
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,910

129
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,110
discussed in the description and

130
