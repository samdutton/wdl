4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,690
hi everyone I'm excited to show you in

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,480
the next 15 minutes how you can use

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,189
structured data to make your website

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,340
stand out more in Google search and how

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,740
that can be done with JavaScript when

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,330
the static implementation is infeasible

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,369
we will start by looking at what

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,489
structured data is and why it is a good

12
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,239
idea for your website then we will look

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,430
at ways to implement it using javascript

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,760
and last but not least we'll take a look

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,739
at how to test and debug your

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,520
implementation all right now what a

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,760
structured data and why is it useful

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,440
structured data is a standardized set of

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,780
additional markup that you can put on

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,149
your pages to tell machines like

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,789
Googlebot more about the content on your

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,120
page on the right side here you can see

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,070
the information for a specific product

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,500
being highlighted in both the image

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,810
search as well as the search results

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,210
including additional information like

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,229
ratings and price we call such results

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,189
rich results to implement structured

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,520
data you can use json-ld microdata or

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,290
rdf a but we recommend using json-ld

31
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,970
here is an example of what a json-ld

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,299
block on your page might look like

33
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,100
besides products there are many

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,659
verticals that can benefit from

35
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,700
structured data and become Milledgeville

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,490
for which results here are some examples

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,920
but you should check the link for the

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,909
full gallery of supported verticals note

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,759
that implementing structured data makes

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,130
the page eligible for rich results but

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,860
does not mean that we will always show

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,799
them for every page that implements it

43
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,070
so now we talked about what structured

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,180
data is and how it benefits your website

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,770
let's walk through a few possible

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,640
implementations we've seen that the

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,860
easiest way is to include a script tag

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,070
the json-ld data in the page this can of

49
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,650
course be done in the backend or

50
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,740
straightening the HTML of a page but

51
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,690
what are the options if you are using

52
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,690
client-side oner JavaScript first of all

53
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,240
it is fine to implement it dynamically

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,270
with client-side JavaScript we recommend

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,340
to use server-side rendering to make

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,920
your website as robust as possible but

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,900
there is no issue with implementing it

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,540
with JavaScript per se in this session

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,760
we will look at three possible

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,520
implementation approaches of course you

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,830
can use JavaScript without libraries or

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,050
frameworks to inject structured data

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,190
into your pages here is an example of a

64
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,830
vanilla JavaScript implementation for a

65
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,420
client-side rendering single page

66
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,890
application it fetches the json-ld data

67
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,100
from an api and injects it into the head

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,459
of the page as Googlebot renders this

69
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,130
page it will execute the JavaScript and

70
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,760
the structured data will be rendered

71
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,220
just make sure that the API is available

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,750
to Googlebot and not blocked by

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,150
robots.txt when you are using frameworks

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,910
such as react angular or view J's

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,910
you very likely have helpers or built-in

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,650
functionality available to insert

77
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,340
structured data into your pages here is

78
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,769
an example of a react component using

79
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,049
the schema helper utility to create

80
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,660
typed json-ld for a person's profile

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,360
page should you not have access to the

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,940
code of your pages that have Google tag

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,680
manager on these pages

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,440
you may use a custom tag in custom

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,110
variables to create structured data from

86
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,600
the information that is on the page to

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,690
do that create a custom HTML tag in your

88
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,880
container and insert the relevant

89
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,269
json-ld as well as the variables for the

90
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,250
values of each field in the json-ld

91
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,150
block then create the necessary custom

92
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,250
JavaScript variables to extract

93
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,200
information from the page so it can be

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,419
inserted into the custom HTML tag

95
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,280
automatically we advise not to copy and

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
paste information from the page

97
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,360
directly into Google tag manager as that

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
will likely cause a mismatch between

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,050
page content and structured data

100
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,720
generated by Google tag manager to rise

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,900
in the future right so we've seen three

102
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,730
ways of generating structured data with

103
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,070
JavaScript let's find out if our

104
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,560
implementation works as expected there

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,360
are two main tools for testing the

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,110
implementations the first one is the

107
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,050
rich results test you can paste a URL

108
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,390
into the tool and see what structured

109
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,940
data is recognized as well as if there

110
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,620
are any issues with the structured data

111
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,130
on the page when using javascript to

112
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,170
generate structured data we recommend

113
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,480
testing a URL instead of pasting code

114
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,390
directly into the tool the other great

115
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,700
tool for testing this is the Google

116
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,340
search console in the URL inspection

117
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,350
tool you can see the structured data

118
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,919
that is detected and if it is valid but

119
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,050
you can also see which pages of your

120
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,419
site were eligible for which results and

121
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,640
which ones have arrows or warnings to

122
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,100
look into if you want to learn more

123
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,690
about Google search in structured data

124
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,790
check out our documentation at

125
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,520

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,880
use this short link to read more on how

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,800
to use javascript to generate structured

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,169
data for your pages thanks a lot for

129
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,120
joining and have a great day bye
