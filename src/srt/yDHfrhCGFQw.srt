4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,519
hello again everybody for those of you

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,750
who don't know me yet my name is

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,279
Elizabeth Sweeney and I'm a product

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,289
manager on the web platform team in

8
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:20,689
Chrome I'm excited to talk with you all

9
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,640
today about the latest and greatest in

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,740
our speed tooling I'll be sharing some

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,869
updates as far as how we think about

12
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,849
measuring user experience including

13
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,439
metrics updates and our new core web

14
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,630
idols initiative as well as making sure

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,760
that we're privy to you know all of the

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,559
newest features products and updates to

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,120
our developer tooling as far as speed

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,950
measurement is concerned so let's dive

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,750
in well I know we've heard it before it

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,940
is worth reiterating why metrics change

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,610
well ultimately it's because our

22
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,560
understanding of how to best measure

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,350
user experience evolves over time as we

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,000
learn more and work through technical

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,980
hurdles we need to make sure that our

26
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,660
metrics and tooling are updated to

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,600
reflect the latest in our learnings

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,050
fundamentally we view it as

29
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,760
mission-critical to give you the most

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,980
accurate and effective mechanisms by

31
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,840
which to optimize your site's experience

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,659
and help you achieve your goals

33
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,399
and that doesn't just mean for one of

34
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,649
you users or a few we want to make sure

35
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,200
that as many users as possible

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,399
regardless of what network they are on

37
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,799
or what hardware they're using are in

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,569
the bucket of users that want to come

39
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,340
back to your site again and again and

40
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,840
that brings us to the impetus behind

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,209
court what vitals we have long been

42
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,859
espousing performance and user

43
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,929
experience quality because we believe

44
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:31,520
that good site performance leads to

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,979
better outcomes for users businesses

46
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,770
developers and for the web in general

47
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,539
the core vitals initiative aims to bring

48
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,520
together a more cohesive picture of web

49
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,319
performance so that there is a better

50
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,729
shared understanding of what should be

51
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,250
prioritized first let's take a moment to

52
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,369
review the metrics themselves

53
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,009
largest contentful paint LCP is a

54
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,659
measurement of perceived loading

55
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,850
experience it marks the point during

56
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,009
page load when the primary or largest

57
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,990
content element has loaded and is

58
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,990
visible to the user within the viewport

59
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,460
it's an important complement to first

60
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,159
contentful paint FCP which only captures

61
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,539
the very beginning of the loading

62
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,450
experience LCP provides a signal about

63
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,760
how quickly a user is actually able to

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,940
see the content of the page to provide a

65
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,970
good user experience sites should strive

66
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,890
to have largest contentful paint occur

67
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,349
within the first 2.5 seconds of the page

68
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,510
starting to load to ensure you're

69
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,860
hitting this target for most of your

70
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,049
users a good threshold to measure is the

71
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,870
75th percentile of page floats segmented

72
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,680
across mobile and desktop devices first

73
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,829
input delay fi D measures the time from

74
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,900
when a user first interact with the page

75
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,660
so they're clicking on something tapping

76
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,060
a button that kind of thing - the time

77
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,069
when the browser is actually able to

78
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,829
respond to that interaction to provide a

79
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,840
good user experience for fid sites

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,060
should strive to have a first input

81
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,060
delay of less than 100 milliseconds to

82
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,350
ensure you're hitting this target for

83
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,450
most of your users a good threshold to

84
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,849
measure again is the 75th percentile of

85
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,599
page loads

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,150
given that FID can only be measured in

87
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,430
the field with real users we want to

88
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,989
make sure that you have a way to locally

89
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,049
debug and optimize fit in the lab that's

90
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,599
where total blocking time TBT comes in

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,299
TBT quantifies load responsiveness

92
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,700
measuring the total amount of time when

93
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,829
the main thread is blocked long enough

94
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,590
to prevent input responsiveness so TVT

95
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,940
measures the total amount of time

96
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,430
between first contentful paint and time

97
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,489
to interactive so in short you should

98
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,079
definitely make sure that you're

99
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,250
leveraging the signals that you're

100
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,889
getting from TBT in the lab to optimize

101
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,010
for F ID in the field cumulative layout

102
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,709
shift CLS is a measurement of visual

103
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,900
stability it quantifies how much of

104
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,299
pages content visually shifts around a

105
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,389
low CLS score is a signal to developers

106
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:55,370
that their users aren't experiencing

107
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,860
undue content shifts a CLS score below

108
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,549
point 1 is considered good CLS in a lab

109
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,170
environment is measured through the end

110
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,689
of a page load whereas in the field you

111
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,549
can measure CLS up to the first user

112
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:09,969
interaction or including all user input

113
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,590
so that was a quick overview but it's

114
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,120
important to remember that our goal is

115
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,860
to have the vast majority of our users

116
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,380
served with fast interactive stable

117
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,870
experiences to that end core web vilas

118
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,240
uses the 75th percentile value of all

119
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,250
page views in the field to evaluate

120
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,380
against these thresholds so in other

121
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,250
words if at least 75% of page views into

122
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,740
a site meet the good threshold then the

123
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,330
site is classified as having a good

124
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,550
performance for that metric and this

125
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,900
applies to all three of the Korowai

126
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,469
vitals LCP fit and CLS the 75th

127
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,000
percentile is used to evaluate all of

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
them

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
as I mentioned before our ability to

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,229
measure user experience quality is

131
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,810
always improving we expect to update

132
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,879
core web idols on an annual basis and

133
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,710
provide regular updates on the future

134
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,289
candidates motivation and implementation

135
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:01,229
status looking ahead toward 2021 the

136
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,300
core Web vitals will be refreshed to

137
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,740
ensure that it reflects the latest in

138
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,300
our learnings and this includes

139
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,979
adjustments to the set of metrics as

140
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,140
well as the thresholds

141
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,450
let's do a quick refresher on the value

142
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,910
of combining both lab and field signals

143
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,920
together to diagnose optimize and

144
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,860
monitor your site's performance lab data

145
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,600
which is synthetically collected in a

146
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,520
testing environment is critical for

147
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,770
tracking down bugs and diagnosing issues

148
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,600
because it is reproducible and has an

149
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,820
immediate feedback loop field data

150
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,800
allows you to understand what real-world

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,230
users are experiencing conditions that

152
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,610
are impossible to simulate in the lab

153
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,800
the real world's messy you mean there's

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,660
permutations of devices there's Network

155
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,880
configurations cache conditions the list

156
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,580
is long either set of metrics taken in

157
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,240
isolation

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,860
aren't nearly as powerful as when

159
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,590
they're combined

160
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,970
and that's why we try to provide you

161
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,370
with ample coverage for both lab and

162
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,500
field tools we have the tools that focus

163
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,660
on providing you with what you know

164
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,310
information about what real users are

165
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,650
experiencing field tools such as the

166
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,150
chrome user experience report search

167
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,950
console and the new Web vitals extension

168
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,170
and then we have our lab tools as well

169
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,000
coming in to provide you with mechanisms

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,460
to see what needs improvement before a

171
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,830
user ever even sees your page and it

172
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,570
gives you a reproducible environment to

173
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,510
debug and optimize those are tools like

174
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,630
the chrome dev tools and lighthouse

175
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,710
PageSpeed insights is a great place to

176
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,480
start to give you a pulse on your core

177
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,490
web idles performance in both the field

178
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,770
and in the lab because it leverages

179
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,900
crooks and lighthouse under the hood

180
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,030
given that the Korowai vitals initiative

181
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,979
aims to help folks know what should be

182
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,380
prioritized first we wanted to make sure

183
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,150
you had full support and tooling

184
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,139
coverage for LCP FID and CLS core what

185
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,610
vitals are now in all of your favorite

186
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,410
developer tools and there are more than

187
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,960
the what is even listed here and that

188
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,940
includes a new web vitals library and a

189
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,380
bunch of ecosystem tools that have

190
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,570
already adopted them you're able to

191
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,340
measure your Korra vitals for a specific

192
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,979
page for your origin locally in the lab

193
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,590
and from real users in the field and as

194
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,570
I mentioned before total blocking time

195
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,810
TBT it's a proxy metric for FID that

196
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,310
allows you to debug and improve your

197
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,680
interactivity in the lab which is why

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,970
it's listed here in the fit column

199
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,250
before we go over all of the latest

200
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,440
updates in each tool I wanted to make

201
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,030
sure that you had all of our tools

202
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,310
mapped in a workflow for core web idols

203
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,190
which tools do what where do I go first

204
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,560
as I said before a good place to start

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,930
to get a general pulse is PageSpeed

206
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,000
insights but all of our tools have a

207
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,160
really critical role to play using

208
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,320
search console allows you to see across

209
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
your entire site and identify which

210
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,240
types of pages need improvement then you

211
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,130
can diagnose and optimize locally with

212
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,020
lighthouse and chrome dev tools we have

213
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,490
some really new capabilities by the way

214
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm excited to share with you in a

215
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,520
moment and then you can prevent

216
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,500
regressions with lighthouse CI and

217
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,510
create a custom dashboard to monitor

218
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,699
your site with crux along the entire

219
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,440
journey you can turn to web dev for

220
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,630
guidance all right let's get into the

221
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,389
tool updates themselves lighthouse just

222
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,580
announced v6 last month which has new

223
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,490
metrics including Cora vitals new audits

224
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,199
and a new performance score let's start

225
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,370
with the updates to the perf score

226
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,990
on a high level we want to make sure

227
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,550
that you can get a sense of your loading

228
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,010
performance interactivity and layout

229
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,990
predictability the metrics and the

230
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,850
weights of those metrics that formulate

231
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,979
the top level score are intended to give

232
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,139
you a balanced view of your user

233
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,870
experience against critical dimensions

234
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,240
of quality while three new metrics have

235
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
been added the core way vitals metrics

236
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,680
three old ones have been removed first

237
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,960
meaningful paint for CPU idle and maths

238
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,450
potential fit these removals are due to

239
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,190
considerations like metric variability

240
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,680
as well as simply having newer metrics

241
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,600
that offer better reflections of the

242
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,310
part of the user experience that we're

243
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,110
trying to measure with that metric

244
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,060
there are also improvements to the

245
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,400
weights based on user feedback for

246
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,990
instance reduction of time to

247
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,670
interactive suite in the final scoring

248
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,920
calculation is in direct response to

249
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,070
user feedback about variability and

250
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,750
inconsistencies in metric optimizations

251
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,670
correlating with improvements to the

252
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,890
user experience however it is still a

253
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,510
valuable signal to understand when a

254
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,640
page is fully interactive and that's why

255
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,580
we still keep it TBT serves as a nice

256
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,770
complement to TTI so that together

257
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,140
you're able to more effectively optimize

258
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,770
for user interactivity

259
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,810
there's also a super nifty scoring

260
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,670
calculator to help explore the

261
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,589
performance score the calculator gives

262
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,420
you a comparison between v5 and v6

263
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,820
scores as well it's not shown here but

264
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,860
it's in the tool and when you run an

265
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,230
audit with lighthouse 600 the report

266
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,089
comes with a link to the calculator with

267
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,310
your results pre-populated so I highly

268
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,870
recommend you check it out

269
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,240
lighthouse v6 also offers quite a few

270
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,280
new audits these are with a focus on

271
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,930
JavaScript analysis and accessibility

272
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,660
you can now easily trace how much unused

273
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,010
code is being shipped with your

274
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,080
application as well as making sure that

275
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,850
you're providing audits to check that

276
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,960
screen readers and other assistive

277
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,300
technologies have all of the information

278
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,670
they need about the behavior and purpose

279
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,380
of controls on your web page to serve

280
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,740
users well

281
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,420
all of the products that lighthouse

282
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,670
powers are updated to reflect the latest

283
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,220
version including lighthouse CI which

284
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,080
now enables you to easily measure your

285
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,360
core web idols on pull requests before

286
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,700
they're merged and deployed PageSpeed

287
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,860
insights psi reports on the lab and

288
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,540
field performance of a page on both

289
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,850
mobile and desktop devices the tool

290
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,830
provides an overview of how real-world

291
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,290
users are experiencing the page that's

292
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,060
powered by crooks and a set of

293
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,370
actionable recommendations on how a site

294
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,500
owner can improve page experience that's

295
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,970
provided by lighthouse

296
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,999
PageSpeed insights and the psi API have

297
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,589
also been upgraded to use lighthouse

298
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,569
Excel under the hood and now support

299
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,099
measuring core web vitals in both the

300
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,739
lab and field sections of the report so

301
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:50,419
core web vitals are annotated with the

302
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,609
blue ribbon that you see here from the

303
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:54,199
crux data set you'll be able to see

304
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,329
whether or not 75% of your loads are

305
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,129
hitting the core web idles thresholds

306
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,169
for each metric in the field for both

307
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,899
your page and for your origin then you

308
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,399
can take a look at your lab data from

309
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,229
lighthouse to see whether or not you are

310
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:07,849
hitting the core web vinyls thresholds

311
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,709
for each metric in a synthetic testing

312
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,569
environment this helps to guide you

313
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,279
towards actionable opportunities to

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,069
improve your pages performance now the

315
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,869
new core web idles report in search

316
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,089
console helps you to identify groups of

317
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,919
pages across your site that require

318
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,809
attention and this is also based on

319
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,120
real-world field data from crux

320
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,790
URL performance is grouped by status

321
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,550
metric type and URL group which is

322
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,249
basically groups of similar webpages the

323
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,749
report is based on the three core web

324
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,059
vitals metrics and it's a great way to

325
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,889
identify pages that need attention on

326
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,529
your site

327
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,870
there are many many cool new things and

328
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,279
dev tools but I'm going to focus on just

329
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,139
two of them right now that are related

330
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,209
to core what vinyls support

331
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,490
first is the capacity to now debug

332
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,079
interaction readiness with total

333
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,240
blocking time in the footer the total

334
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,149
blocking time TBT metric again the proxy

335
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,249
for first input delay is now shown in

336
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,389
the footer of the chrome dev tools

337
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,309
performance panel when you measure page

338
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,139
performance the performance panel has a

339
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,089
new experience section that can help you

340
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,639
detect unexpected layout shifts this is

341
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,559
helpful for finding and fixing visuals

342
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,329
instability issues on your page that

343
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,059
contribute to cumulative layout shift so

344
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,619
you select the layout shift to view it's

345
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,389
details in the summary tab and to

346
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:22,860
visualize where the shift itself

347
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,490
occurred

348
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,319
hover over the moved from and move to

349
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,119
fields and for more information on

350
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:28,800
everything that's new in dev tools um

351
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,569
see that what's new in dev tools chrome

352
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:35,040
84 link that's here the chrome UX report

353
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,769
crux is a public data set of real user

354
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,199
experience data on millions of websites

355
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,879
we just hit over 7 million so that's

356
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,309
awesome it measures field versions of

357
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,259
all of the court web idols even if you

358
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,119
don't have room on your site crux can

359
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,920
provide a quick and easy way to assess

360
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,050
your core web idols the newly redesigned

361
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,939
crux dashboard allows you to easily

362
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,709
track an origins performance over time

363
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,019
and now you can use it to monitor the

364
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,549
distributions of all of your core web

365
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,499
idols metrics to get started with the

366
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,240
dashboard you can check out the tutorial

367
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,579
on web dev we've also introduced this

368
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,129
new core web idols landing page to make

369
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,720
it even easier to see how your site is

370
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,730
performing at a glance there is also a

371
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,860
new crux API for you to use build from

372
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,449
